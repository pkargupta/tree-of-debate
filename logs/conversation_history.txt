	- Topic: Guiding Students to Resolve Errors Socratically
	- Topic Description: Our approach guides students to generate a list of bug fixes and resolve errors through Socratic questioning, enabling them to understand and correct their mistakes independently. This method helps students develop problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in socratic error resolution via student-driven bug fixes. Our approach uniquely empowers students to independently resolve errors through Socratic questioning, distinguishing it from the opposing paper's focus on novice tutor knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques. This novelty stems from our method's emphasis on student-driven bug fixes, as evidenced by our Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset and adaptive LLM-based tutor. In contrast, the opposing paper's techniques, such as single-turn responses and direct bug fixes, do not facilitate the same level of student autonomy.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in socratic error resolution. The opposing paper's approach to guiding students to resolve errors socratically is not novel as our own paper already explores the use of expert-guided decision-making, which includes engaging with the student's error through techniques such as asking questions and simplifying the problem. This indicates that the concept of Socratic questioning in error resolution is not new. Furthermore, our paper's focus on addressing the novice-expert knowledge gap provides a more comprehensive solution to the problem of guiding students to resolve errors.

	-Author 0: I acknowledge the Opposition's point regarding the use of expert-guided decision-making, but clarify that our approach uniquely empowers students to drive the error resolution process independently through Socratic questioning. I question the Opposition's claim of comprehensiveness, as their approach relies on expert guidance, potentially limiting student autonomy. Our Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset and adaptive LLM-based tutor remain distinct contributions not addressed by the Opposition.
	-Author 1: I acknowledge the opposition's emphasis on student-driven error resolution, but counter that our expert-guided approach still utilizes Socratic questioning, rendering their novelty claim overstated. I request clarification on how the opposition's adaptive LLM-based tutor ensures student-driven independence without relying on pre-programmed responses. Furthermore, I assert that our novice-expert knowledge gap focus provides a foundational understanding necessary for effective Socratic error resolution, regardless of the level of student autonomy.

	-Author 0: I argue that autonomous socratic error resolution via adaptive llm-based tutoring. Our approach uniquely integrates adaptive LLM-based tutoring with student-driven Socratic questioning, ensuring independence in error resolution without relying on pre-programmed responses. This autonomy is further enhanced by our Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of Socratic error resolution. In contrast, the opposing paper's expert-guided approach, despite utilizing Socratic questioning, inherently limits student autonomy.
	-Author 1: I argue that expert-guided socratic error resolution as foundational framework. Our paper's expert-guided approach, utilizing Socratic questioning, provides a foundational framework for effective error resolution, addressing the novice-expert knowledge gap and enabling more comprehensive student understanding. This foundational framework is essential for both expert-guided and student-driven error resolution methods, including the opposition's adaptive LLM-based tutoring approach. By establishing this foundation, our work inherently contributes to the development of more autonomous Socratic error resolution methods.

	- Topic: Contextualizing Error Fixes through Interconnected Bug Resolution
	- Topic Description: Our approach recognizes the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive error-fixing process.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in interconnected bug resolution via socratic debugging. Our approach uniquely leverages Socratic debugging to contextualize error fixes, distinguishing it from the opposing paper's focus on novice tutor knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques. This distinction is evident in our use of interconnected bug resolution, which is not addressed in the opposing paper. Our Socratic debugging methodology facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process, setting our contributions apart.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in interconnected error resolution. The opposing paper's claim of novelty in contextualizing error fixes through interconnected bug resolution is unfounded, as our own paper does not address this specific aspect, indicating a gap in the literature that the opposing paper fails to acknowledge. Furthermore, the opposing paper does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a novel approach to interconnected error resolution. Our paper's focus on addressing the novice-expert knowledge gap and engaging error remediation techniques does not overlap with the opposing paper's claim, suggesting that the opposing paper's contribution is not novel in the context of our work.

	-Author 0: I acknowledge the Opposition's assertion of a literature gap in interconnected error resolution, yet their argument inadvertently underscores the novelty of our approach in filling this very gap. I would like clarification on how the Opposition's paper on novice-expert knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques does not overlap with our contextualization of error fixes via interconnected bug resolution. Notably, our Socratic debugging methodology provides empirical evidence of a novel, comprehensive error-fixing process, distinguishing our contributions from the Opposition's work.
	-Author 1: I appreciate the Opposition's acknowledgement of the literature gap in interconnected error resolution, yet I maintain that filling a gap does not inherently establish novelty relative to our work, especially since our focus on novice-expert knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques remains distinct. I'd like to request further clarification on how the Opposition's Socratic debugging methodology empirically demonstrates novelty in the context of our paper's contributions. Moreover, I'd like the Opposition to address whether their approach could be considered an extension or complementary work to our error remediation techniques, rather than a novel contribution.

	-Author 0: I argue that contextualizing interconnected bug fixes through empirically-validated socratic debugging. Our paper introduces a novel approach to contextualizing error fixes through interconnected bug resolution, empirically validated by our Socratic debugging methodology. This methodology is distinct from the opposition's focus on novice-expert knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques, as evidenced by our use of Socratic questions to traverse the error space and resolve variables grounded in student responses. Our approach fills a literature gap in interconnected error resolution, providing a comprehensive error-fixing process that is not addressed in the opposing paper.
	-Author 1: I argue that interconnected error remediation through expert-guided decision-making. Our paper's focus on expert-guided decision-making techniques, such as inferring student errors and engaging with error traces, provides a novel approach to interconnected error remediation, distinct from the opposition's Socratic debugging methodology. This distinction highlights the complementary nature of our contributions, rather than the opposition's claim of novelty. Furthermore, our approach addresses the novice-expert knowledge gap, providing a more comprehensive error-fixing process.
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Novel Socratic Instruction Method
	- Topic Description: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in socratic error resolution via dynamic questioning. Our paper's TreeInstruct method introduces a novel approach to Socratic error resolution through dynamic tree-based questioning, distinguishing it from the opposition's method which focuses on defining 'error' as a student's degree of understanding. This dynamic questioning enables students to resolve errors independently, a key aspect of Socratic instruction. The opposition's method, while supporting novices, does not provide a similar dynamic questioning mechanism.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in socratic instruction method. The opposing author's claimed novelty in Socratic instruction method is not novel due to the existing evidence in our paper that already explores the use of Socratic method in remediating student mistakes. Our paper discusses the Socratic method as one of the good practices in remediating student mistakes, which undermines the opposing author's claim of novelty. Furthermore, our counter evidence shows that we have already implemented a conversation pattern that utilizes Socratic questioning, making the opposing author's contribution not novel.

	-Author 0: I acknowledge the opposition's claim that their paper explores the use of the Socratic method in remediating student mistakes, but I argue that the novelty of our TreeInstruct method lies in its dynamic tree-based questioning mechanism, which is not explicitly mentioned in the opposition's paper. I request clarification on the opposition's 'conversation pattern' and how it compares to our dynamic tree-based questioning approach. Our paper's emphasis on state space estimation for multi-turn Socratic instruction also remains unaddressed by the opposition.
	-Author 1: I acknowledge the opposition's emphasis on the dynamic tree-based questioning mechanism, but argue that our conversation pattern, which utilizes a decision tree to guide Socratic questioning, is analogous to their approach. I clarify that our decision tree is not static, but rather adaptive, allowing for multi-turn questioning. I request further evidence on the opposition's state space estimation method to demonstrate its novelty relative to existing methods.

	-Author 0: I argue that dynamic socratic guidance via adaptive state space estimation. Our paper's TreeInstruct method uniquely integrates adaptive state space estimation with dynamic tree-based questioning, enabling effective Socratic guidance for students. This synergy distinguishes our approach from the opposition's adaptive decision tree, which lacks explicit state space estimation. By leveraging this novel combination, TreeInstruct provides a more comprehensive framework for multi-turn Socratic instruction.
	-Author 1: I argue that adaptive socratic guidance supersedes state space estimation novelty. Our adaptive decision tree for Socratic questioning already encompasses the essence of dynamic guidance, rendering the opposition's state space estimation novelty redundant. Furthermore, our expert-guided decision-making approach ensures high-quality tutoring, which the opposition's TreeInstruct method lacks. This underscores the superiority of our approach in providing effective Socratic instruction.
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Balancing Guidance with Independence
	- Topic Description: Unlike existing LLM-based tutors that 'are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses', our approach strikes a balance between guiding students to generate a list of bug fixes and allowing them to resolve errors independently, promoting problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novel socratic guidance balancing independence and expertise. Our paper uniquely balances guidance with independence by leveraging Socratic questioning to adapt to new student responses, while the opposing paper focuses on novice support and scaling high-quality tutoring through expert guidance. This distinction highlights the novelty of our approach in promoting problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding. Our evidence demonstrates a more nuanced balance between guidance and independence.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in balancing guidance and independence. The opposing author's claim of balancing guidance with independence is not novel as our paper already explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes, which inherently requires balancing guidance and independence. Furthermore, our evidence shows that novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces, indicating that our approach already addresses the need for balancing guidance and independence. The opposing author's contribution does not provide a substantial new insight or approach in this regard.

	-Author 0: I acknowledge the opposition's assertion that their paper explores balancing guidance and independence through LLMs in math mistake remediation. However, I question whether 'passive remediation language' truly embodies the adaptive Socratic questioning approach that our paper uniquely contributes. Can the opposition clarify how their 'passive remediation language' actively engages students in problem-solving, as opposed to simply providing guidance?
	-Author 1: I acknowledge the Opposition's clarification request and would like to clarify that our 'passive remediation language' is, in fact, a foundational step towards adaptive guidance, as it provides a baseline for understanding how novices and LLMs interact. However, I must reiterate that the Opposition's Socratic questioning approach, while adaptive, does not fundamentally depart from our explored concept of balancing guidance and independence. Could the Opposition provide more context on how their Socratic questioning approach scales to accommodate diverse student error traces and promote problem-solving skills in a more novel manner than our existing work?

	-Author 0: I argue that adaptive socratic guidance: novel scalability in balancing independence and expertise. Our paper uniquely introduces a scalable, adaptive Socratic questioning approach that effectively balances guidance with independence, distinguishing itself from existing LLM-based tutors and the opposition's foundational yet passive remediation language. By tracing variable resolutions and promoting student-driven bug fix generation, our method fosters problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding in a more nuanced and novel manner. This scalability in balancing independence and expertise sets our contribution apart in the context of educational support systems.
	-Author 1: I argue that foundational guidance underpins scalable socratic independence. Our paper's exploration of novice support and passive remediation language serves as a crucial foundation for scalable, adaptive Socratic questioning approaches. This foundational work inherently addresses the need for balancing guidance and independence, rendering the opposition's contribution an incremental, rather than novel, advancement. By acknowledging the opposition's scalability, we underscore the necessity of our foundational research in truly novel educational support systems.
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution
	- Topic Description: Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in interconnected bug resolution via socratic guidance. Our paper uniquely leverages interconnected bug resolution through socratic guidance, distinguishing it from the opposition's expert-guided decision-making and novice-expert knowledge gap approaches. This is evident in our structured planning methodology and the absence of direct bug fixes in our TreeInstruct framework. Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in interconnected bug resolution. The opposing paper's claim of Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution is not novel as our own paper, through Bridge, already leverages cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making framework, which inherently acknowledges the interconnectedness of errors. Furthermore, our evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in remediating math mistakes, indirectly addressing the interconnected bug resolution. The opposition's claim does not provide a distinct or innovative contribution beyond our existing work.

	-Author 0: I acknowledge the opposition's attempt to draw parallels between Bridge's cognitive task analysis and our interconnected bug resolution via socratic guidance. However, I clarify that our approach uniquely integrates structured planning methodology, which is absent in Bridge, and explicitly targets bug resolution in programming contexts, unlike Bridge's focus on math mistakes. Can the opposition provide evidence that Bridge's decision-making framework has been successfully applied to programming error fixing, demonstrating its direct relevance to our topic?
	-Author 1: Here is my response to your last turn...

	-Author 0: I argue that interconnected bug resolution via socratic guidance in programming contexts: a novelty distinction. Our paper uniquely integrates structured planning methodology and socratic guidance to facilitate comprehensive error-fixing in programming contexts, distinguishing it from the opposition's expert-guided decision-making approach in math contexts. This distinction highlights our novel contribution to Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution. Evidence from our multi-bug debugging dataset and success rate improvements support this novelty claim.
	-Author 1: I argue that cognitive task analysis as interconnected error resolution foundation. Our Bridge approach's cognitive task analysis inherently acknowledges interconnected error resolution, providing a foundational framework that can be adapted to various contexts, including programming. This adaptability undermines the opposition's novelty claim, as our method's core principles can be applied to facilitate comprehensive error-fixing in different domains. The opposition's structured planning methodology is an extension of our foundational work, rather than a novel contribution.
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings
	- Topic Description: Our method yields significant improvements in success rates for both syntactical and conceptual bugs in multi-bug settings, with overall improvements of 16.6% and 11.59%, respectively, and improvements of 13.47% and 14.89% across conversation metrics.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in multi-bug resolution via socratic instruction. Our paper uniquely addresses multi-bug settings through a socratic, question-based approach, differing from the opposition's expert-guided decision-making framework. This distinction is crucial as it enables students to independently resolve bugs, enhancing their learning experience. Our method's novelty lies in its structured planning for multi-turn educational guidance.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in multi-bug success rates. The opposing paper's claim of Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings is not novel as our own paper, through Bridge, already addresses the remediation of mistakes in a manner that can be applied to multi-bug settings, thereby achieving similar success rate improvements without explicitly claiming it. Furthermore, our paper's focus on expert-guided decision-making for error remediation provides a more comprehensive approach to addressing errors, which can inherently lead to improved success rates in various settings, including multi-bug ones. The opposition's claim, therefore, does not introduce a new or groundbreaking concept relative to our work.

	-Author 0: I acknowledge the Opposition's argument regarding Bridge's potential application to multi-bug settings, yet I question the Opposition's assumption that their approach inherently leads to improved success rates without explicit adaptation or evaluation in such settings. I would like to request clarification on whether any experiments or analyses were conducted specifically for multi-bug scenarios in the Opposition's paper. Our paper's novelty, however, remains in its explicit focus and empirical validation of success rate improvements in multi-bug settings through socratic instruction.
	-Author 1: I acknowledge the opposition's request for clarification and confirm that, while our paper did not conduct experiments exclusively for multi-bug settings, our framework's design inherently accommodates such scenarios, as evidenced by Section 3.2 of our paper, which outlines the scalability of our expert-guided decision-making approach. This scalability is a crucial aspect that can be directly applied to multi-bug settings without requiring explicit adaptation. I further argue that the opposition's emphasis on 'explicit focus and empirical validation' does not negate the novelty overlap, as our paper's broader applicability and comprehensive error remediation strategy encompass the opposition's more narrowly focused contributions.

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in socratic, multi-turn guidance for multi-bug resolution. Our paper uniquely contributes to the topic by introducing a socratic, question-based approach that enables students to independently resolve multi-bug errors through structured, multi-turn educational guidance. This approach is distinct from the opposition's expert-guided decision-making framework and demonstrates empirical success rate improvements in multi-bug settings. Our novelty lies in the explicit focus on and validation of this socratic instruction methodology in addressing complex, interdependent bugs.
	-Author 1: I argue that comprehensive error remediation encompasses multi-bug success rates. Our expert-guided decision-making framework inherently addresses multi-bug settings, rendering the opposition's explicit focus on this aspect redundant. The scalability of our approach, as outlined in Section 3.2, ensures its applicability to various error scenarios without necessitating specific adaptations. This comprehensive strategy undercuts the novelty of the opposition's socratic instruction methodology in improving success rates in multi-bug settings.
