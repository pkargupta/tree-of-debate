Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning
	- Topic Description: Our approach helps students fix errors by guiding them to resolve their own errors through Socratic questioning, which enables them to develop a deeper understanding of the material. This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in socratic questioning approach. Our paper's contributions are novel due to the unique combination of Socratic questioning and expert-guided decision-making, which enables students to resolve errors independently and effectively. Unlike the opposing paper, our approach leverages large language models to support novice tutors in addressing student mistakes, while also providing a more comprehensive and challenging multi-bug dataset. This combination of features sets our paper apart from the opposing paper's more limited and topic-agnostic error categories.
	-Author 1: I argue that novelty claim misaligned with actual contributions. The opposing paper's claimed novelty is misaligned with their actual contributions, as their approach is not fundamentally different from our own expert-guided decision-making process. Their use of Socratic questioning is merely a superficial adaptation of our approach, rather than a novel contribution. Furthermore, their approach still relies on LLMs, which are a key component of our own work, and does not address the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors.

	-Author 0: While the opposition acknowledges our use of Socratic questioning, they fail to recognize the significance of our multi-bug dataset, which is a novel contribution that allows for more comprehensive error resolution. This dataset is not a superficial adaptation, but rather a crucial component that sets our approach apart from the opposition's. Furthermore, our use of LLMs is not a direct copy, but rather a novel application that enables novice tutors to effectively address student mistakes.
	-Author 1: While the opposition highlights the significance of their multi-bug dataset, I argue that it is still a derivative of our own work, as it is based on the same error categories and knowledge gap that our approach addresses. Furthermore, their novel application of LLMs is still limited by the same knowledge gap, and does not provide a fundamental shift in the way novice tutors address student mistakes. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying knowledge gap, which our paper provides.

	-Author 0: I argue that novel socratic questioning approach combines expert guidance and multi-bug dataset. Our paper's novelty lies in its unique combination of Socratic questioning and expert-guided decision-making, supported by a comprehensive multi-bug dataset. This approach enables students to resolve errors independently and effectively, addressing the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors. By leveraging LLMs to support novice tutors, our approach provides a fundamental shift in the way student mistakes are addressed.
	-Author 1: I argue that expert-guided human-llm approach overcomes limitations of novice tutors and socratic questioning alone. Our paper's contributions are novel due to the expert-guided human-LLM approach that bridges the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors, providing a more effective and comprehensive solution to guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning. This approach overcomes the limitations of novice tutors and Socratic questioning alone, enabling students to develop a deeper understanding of the material and resolve errors independently. Our results demonstrate the promising potential of this approach in scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making.

	- Topic: Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback
	- Topic Description: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors that are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback. Our paper's contributions are novel due to its unique approach to traversing the space using Socratic questions and tracing variables, which is not present in the opposing paper.

Furthermore, our paper's use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes provides a more challenging and realistic testing ground for our approach.
	-Author 1: I argue that novelty claim misaligned with actual contributions. The other paper's claimed novelty of adapting to student responses is not novel as it is a direct result of their expert-guided decision-making process, which is not a novel contribution itself. Furthermore, their approach is not significantly different from our own, as they also use LLMs to generate initial responses that are further edited by the tutor, similar to our own approach. This suggests that their claimed novelty is not a distinct contribution, but rather a natural extension of their own approach.

	-Author 0: While the opposition claims that our approach is not novel due to its reliance on expert-guided decision-making, I argue that this process is unique in its ability to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback through the use of Socratic questions and variable tracing, which is not present in their approach. Furthermore, our use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes provides a more challenging and realistic testing ground for our approach, which is not accounted for in the opposition's paper.

	-Author 1: While the opposition acknowledges the use of Socratic questions and variable tracing, they fail to address the fact that these methods are not novel contributions, but rather a natural extension of their own approach. Furthermore, the use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes, while beneficial, does not necessarily imply that their approach is more novel than ours. In fact, our approach has been shown to be effective in adapting to new student responses and providing tailored feedback, which is not explicitly demonstrated in the opposition's paper.
