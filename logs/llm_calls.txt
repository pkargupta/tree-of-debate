PROMPT: You are a helpful assistant. You are an author of a paper that is trying to convince others of your paper's contributions towards {'argument_title': 'helping students fix their errors', 'description': 'helping students fix their errors'}.Below is a list of relevant evidence retrieved from your paper:

Retrieved Evidence #1: In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
Retrieved Evidence #2: The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
Retrieved Evidence #3: First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
Retrieved Evidence #4: Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
Retrieved Evidence #5: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
Based on the evidence, output a list of 2 diverse, specific arguments on your paper's major unique contributions towards {'argument_title': 'helping students fix their errors', 'description': 'helping students fix their errors'}, that are all supported by the evidence (ONLY quote excerpts/phrases from the evidence, DO NOT mention the specific Evidence #).

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
	- Evidence #2. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
	- Evidence #5. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Addressing Novice Tutor Knowledge Gap: Our work explores the potential of large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes, thus helping students fix their errors. This is particularly important due to the growing demand for online tutoring platforms that often employ novice tutors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work

	- Opposition Claim #2: Engaging Error Remediation Techniques: Experts in our study used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding, providing a more effective approach to helping students fix their errors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes

Based on the debate history and your/your opposition's arguments and evidence, you must construct a new, stronger argument related to the "topic".

Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Guiding Students to Resolve Errors Socratically
	- Topic Description: Our approach guides students to generate a list of bug fixes and resolve errors through Socratic questioning, enabling them to understand and correct their mistakes independently. This method helps students develop problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.

Debate History:

	-You: I argue that novelty in socratic error resolution via student-driven bug fixes. Our approach uniquely empowers students to independently resolve errors through Socratic questioning, distinguishing it from the opposing paper's focus on novice tutor knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques. This novelty stems from our method's emphasis on student-driven bug fixes, as evidenced by our Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset and adaptive LLM-based tutor. In contrast, the opposing paper's techniques, such as single-turn responses and direct bug fixes, do not facilitate the same level of student autonomy.
	-Opposition: I argue that lack of novelty in socratic error resolution. The opposing paper's approach to guiding students to resolve errors socratically is not novel as our own paper already explores the use of expert-guided decision-making, which includes engaging with the student's error through techniques such as asking questions and simplifying the problem. This indicates that the concept of Socratic questioning in error resolution is not new. Furthermore, our paper's focus on addressing the novice-expert knowledge gap provides a more comprehensive solution to the problem of guiding students to resolve errors.

	-You: I acknowledge the Opposition's point regarding the use of expert-guided decision-making, but clarify that our approach uniquely empowers students to drive the error resolution process independently through Socratic questioning. I question the Opposition's claim of comprehensiveness, as their approach relies on expert guidance, potentially limiting student autonomy. Our Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset and adaptive LLM-based tutor remain distinct contributions not addressed by the Opposition.
	-Opposition: I acknowledge the opposition's emphasis on student-driven error resolution, but counter that our expert-guided approach still utilizes Socratic questioning, rendering their novelty claim overstated. I request clarification on how the opposition's adaptive LLM-based tutor ensures student-driven independence without relying on pre-programmed responses.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #2. Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
	- Evidence #3. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #4. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding

Description of Claim: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.
Evidence: By contrast, our dataset uses real experienced educators, human tutors and students from Title I schools with a need of high-dosage tutoring. Additionally, prior datasets focus on teacher strategies (e.g., "ask an open-ended question") and these strategies can often be directly observed in their responses (Stasaski et al., 2020; Caines et al., 2020; Macina et al., 2023b).

PROMPT: Your objective is to check if a given evidence is relevant to a claim or not (relevancy means evidence that helps either support, refute, or clarify the given claim).
Claim: Balancing Guidance with Independence.
Description of Claim: Unlike existing LLM-based tutors that 'are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses', our approach strikes a balance between guiding students to generate a list of bug fixes and allowing them to resolve errors independently, promoting problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.
Evidence: Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author on your claim topic:
	- Topic: Contextualizing Error Fixes through Interconnected Bug Resolution
	- Topic Description: Our approach recognizes the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive error-fixing process.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
	- Evidence #2. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
	- Evidence #5. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Addressing Novice Tutor Knowledge Gap: Our work explores the potential of large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes, thus helping students fix their errors. This is particularly important due to the growing demand for online tutoring platforms that often employ novice tutors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work

	- Opposition Claim #2: Engaging Error Remediation Techniques: Experts in our study used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding, providing a more effective approach to helping students fix their errors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper, with respect to the topic, Contextualizing Error Fixes through Interconnected Bug Resolution.

Below, you are given the previous set of arguments and the current set of arguments. 

"previous arguments": 1. Novelty in Interconnected Bug Resolution via Socratic Debugging: Our approach uniquely leverages Socratic debugging to contextualize error fixes, distinguishing it from the opposing paper's focus on novice tutor knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques. This distinction is evident in our use of interconnected bug resolution, which is not addressed in the opposing paper. Our Socratic debugging methodology facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process, setting our contributions apart.. 2. Lack of Novelty in Interconnected Error Resolution: The opposing paper's claim of novelty in contextualizing error fixes through interconnected bug resolution is unfounded, as our own paper does not address this specific aspect, indicating a gap in the literature that the opposing paper fails to acknowledge. Furthermore, the opposing paper does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a novel approach to interconnected error resolution. Our paper's focus on addressing the novice-expert knowledge gap and engaging error remediation techniques does not overlap with the opposing paper's claim, suggesting that the opposing paper's contribution is not novel in the context of our work..

"current arguments": 1. Contextualizing Interconnected Bug Fixes through Empirically-Validated Socratic Debugging: Our paper introduces a novel approach to contextualizing error fixes through interconnected bug resolution, empirically validated by our Socratic debugging methodology. This methodology is distinct from the opposition's focus on novice-expert knowledge gaps and error remediation techniques, as evidenced by our use of Socratic questions to traverse the error space and resolve variables grounded in student responses. Our approach fills a literature gap in interconnected error resolution, providing a comprehensive error-fixing process that is not addressed in the opposing paper.. 2. Interconnected Error Remediation through Expert-Guided Decision-Making: Our paper's focus on expert-guided decision-making techniques, such as inferring student errors and engaging with error traces, provides a novel approach to interconnected error remediation, distinct from the opposition's Socratic debugging methodology. This distinction highlights the complementary nature of our contributions, rather than the opposition's claim of novelty. Furthermore, our approach addresses the novice-expert knowledge gap, providing a more comprehensive error-fixing process..

Retrieved Evidence #1: * We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset with 150 expert-annotated, challenging conceptual and syntactical bugs and their fixes. * Extensive experiments on an existing benchmark and our constructed dataset demonstrate that TreeInstruct can be universally applied to both open and closed source-settings
Retrieved Evidence #2: Realworld code debugging often involves multiple, potentially interdependent conceptual and syntactical bugs. For instance, Figure 1 shows that first resolving the Student's conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps them identify their recursive syntactical bug (Figure 1)
Retrieved Evidence #3: First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
Retrieved Evidence #4: The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
Retrieved Evidence #5: Across all multi-bug settings, we see an overall improvement of 16.6% and 11.59% in the success rates for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively.

PROMPT: Your objective is to check if a given evidence is relevant to a claim or not (relevancy means evidence that helps either support, refute, or clarify the given claim).
Claim: Expert-Guided Decision-Making for Error Remediation.
Description of Claim: Our approach, Bridge, translates an expert's thought process into a decision-making framework for remediating mistakes, 'leveraging cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making framework.' This enables more effective error fixing by capturing the expert's intention and strategy.
Evidence: The LM estimates the type of error, the strategy of error remediation, and the instructor intention behind the remediation (all are chosen from a predetermined set). However, our methodology makes use of a more structured planning approach that accounts for the inherent multi-turn nature of educational guidance.

Description of Claim: Our work explores the potential of large language models to 'close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes,' providing a solution for novice tutors who struggle to address student mistakes and seize prime learning opportunities.
Evidence: TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixesall carefully constructed and annotated by experts.

Claim: Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution.
Description of Claim: Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.
Evidence: Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013).

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author on your claim topic:
	- Topic: Novel Socratic Instruction Method
	- Topic Description: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
	- Evidence #2. The role of technology and language models is being widely discussed with respect to its impact on student dependence and lack of critical thinking. Given the rapid and wide-scale deployment of LMs to the public, we emphasize the importance of designing Socratic dialogue systems in the hopes of bettering educational support for all students and educators
	- Evidence #3. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #4. Instruct, Not Assist: LLM-based Multi-Turn Planning and Hierarchical Questioning for Socratic Code Debugging Priyanka Kargupta*, Ishika Agarwal*, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Jiawei Han 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign {pk36, ishikaa2, dilek, hanj}@illinois.eduvoN]LC.sc[v.:viXra Abstract Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance
	- Evidence #5. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a novel method, TreeInstruct, for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction. We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset, MULTI-DEBUG, with 150 expert-annotated conceptual and syntactical problems and buggy solutions/fixes

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Novice Support through Socratic Error Resolution: Our approach supports novices by defining 'error' as a student's degree of understanding, aligning with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics. This enables effective guidance for students who are not content experts.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code

	- Opposition Claim #2: Scaling High-Quality Tutoring with Expert Guidance: Our method allows for scaling high-quality tutoring through expert-guided decision-making, overcoming the limitations of novices and LLMs who use passive remediation language and fail to engage with student error traces.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Note that we assume bug fixes are provided, a common scenario in educational settings (e.g., assignments, exams) where ground-truth solutions are available from human instructors or platforms like LeetCode. As our focus is steering an LLM towards Socratic guidance, generating these solutions for real-world tutoring applications is left for future work

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper, with respect to the topic, Novel Socratic Instruction Method.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author about their claimed novelty:
	- Novelty Claim: Novel Socratic Instruction Method
	- Novelty Claim Description: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You initially argued that your own paper has the following novelties:
	- Argument #1. Novice Support through Socratic Error Resolution: Our approach supports novices by defining 'error' as a student's degree of understanding, aligning with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics. This enables effective guidance for students who are not content experts.
	- Argument #2. Scaling High-Quality Tutoring with Expert Guidance: Our method allows for scaling high-quality tutoring through expert-guided decision-making, overcoming the limitations of novices and LLMs who use passive remediation language and fail to engage with student error traces.


You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
	- Evidence #2. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #3. Effective remediation coincides with educators engaging with the mathematical details in student responses, which in turn fosters strong teacher-student relationships and student motivation (Wentzel, 1997; Pianta et al., 2003; Robinson, 2022; Wentzel, 2022; Easley and Zwoyer, 1975; Brown and Burton, 1978; Carpenter et al., 1999, 2003; Lester, 2007; Loewenberg Ball and Forzani, 2009). Prior education research discusses multiple good practices in remediating student mistakes, ranging from visual aids (CAST, 2018) to the Socratic method (Lepper and Woolverton, 2002)
	- Evidence #4. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #5. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Novel Socratic Instruction Method: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Specifically, we search for a three turn conversation pattern where (1) the tutor sends a message containing a question mark "?", (2) the student responds via text, then (3) the tutor uses a signalling expression. The set of signalling expressions were validated on a random sample of 100 conversations to ensure complete coverage

	- Opposition Claim #2: Balancing Guidance with Independence: Unlike existing LLM-based tutors that 'are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses', our approach strikes a balance between guiding students to generate a list of bug fixes and allowing them to resolve errors independently, promoting problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper, with respect to the topic, Novel Socratic Instruction Method.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author (Opposition).

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are all novel relative to the other paper. Refer to the Opposition's arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

Here is your conversation debate history with the opposition paper. You must respond to the last argument presented by your opposition in debate (tagged between <respond_to_this> and </respond_to_this>). A response may consist of an acknowledgement of the opposition's previous response, any clarifying questions based on the opposition's claims and reasoning, and any clarifications of your own presented arguments based on the opposition.

Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Novel Socratic Instruction Method
	- Topic Description: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.

Debate History:

	-You: I argue that novelty in socratic error resolution via dynamic questioning. Our paper's TreeInstruct method introduces a novel approach to Socratic error resolution through dynamic tree-based questioning, distinguishing it from the opposition's method which focuses on defining 'error' as a student's degree of understanding. This dynamic questioning enables students to resolve errors independently, a key aspect of Socratic instruction. The opposition's method, while supporting novices, does not provide a similar dynamic questioning mechanism.
	<respond_to_this>
-Opposition: I argue that lack of novelty in socratic instruction method. The opposing author's claimed novelty in Socratic instruction method is not novel due to the existing evidence in our paper that already explores the use of Socratic method in remediating student mistakes. Our paper discusses the Socratic method as one of the good practices in remediating student mistakes, which undermines the opposing author's claim of novelty. Furthermore, our counter evidence shows that we have already implemented a conversation pattern that utilizes Socratic questioning, making the opposing author's contribution not novel.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
	- Evidence #2. The role of technology and language models is being widely discussed with respect to its impact on student dependence and lack of critical thinking. Given the rapid and wide-scale deployment of LMs to the public, we emphasize the importance of designing Socratic dialogue systems in the hopes of bettering educational support for all students and educators
	- Evidence #3. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #4. Instruct, Not Assist: LLM-based Multi-Turn Planning and Hierarchical Questioning for Socratic Code Debugging Priyanka Kargupta*, Ishika Agarwal*, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Jiawei Han 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign {pk36, ishikaa2, dilek, hanj}@illinois.eduvoN]LC.sc[v.:viXra Abstract Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance
	- Evidence #5. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a novel method, TreeInstruct, for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction. We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset, MULTI-DEBUG, with 150 expert-annotated conceptual and syntactical problems and buggy solutions/fixes

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Novice Support through Socratic Error Resolution: Our approach supports novices by defining 'error' as a student's degree of understanding, aligning with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics. This enables effective guidance for students who are not content experts.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code

	- Opposition Claim #2: Scaling High-Quality Tutoring with Expert Guidance: Our method allows for scaling high-quality tutoring through expert-guided decision-making, overcoming the limitations of novices and LLMs who use passive remediation language and fail to engage with student error traces.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Note that we assume bug fixes are provided, a common scenario in educational settings (e.g., assignments, exams) where ground-truth solutions are available from human instructors or platforms like LeetCode. As our focus is steering an LLM towards Socratic guidance, generating these solutions for real-world tutoring applications is left for future work

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
	- Evidence #2. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #3. Effective remediation coincides with educators engaging with the mathematical details in student responses, which in turn fosters strong teacher-student relationships and student motivation (Wentzel, 1997; Pianta et al., 2003; Robinson, 2022; Wentzel, 2022; Easley and Zwoyer, 1975; Brown and Burton, 1978; Carpenter et al., 1999, 2003; Lester, 2007; Loewenberg Ball and Forzani, 2009). Prior education research discusses multiple good practices in remediating student mistakes, ranging from visual aids (CAST, 2018) to the Socratic method (Lepper and Woolverton, 2002)
	- Evidence #4. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #5. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Novel Socratic Instruction Method: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Specifically, we search for a three turn conversation pattern where (1) the tutor sends a message containing a question mark "?", (2) the student responds via text, then (3) the tutor uses a signalling expression. The set of signalling expressions were validated on a random sample of 100 conversations to ensure complete coverage

	- Opposition Claim #2: Balancing Guidance with Independence: Unlike existing LLM-based tutors that 'are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses', our approach strikes a balance between guiding students to generate a list of bug fixes and allowing them to resolve errors independently, promoting problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making

	- Evidence #4. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #5. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Novel Socratic Instruction Method: Our approach, TreeInstruct, introduces a novel method for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction, as seen in 'a novel method... for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.' This enables students to resolve errors independently through Socratic questioning.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Specifically, we search for a three turn conversation pattern where (1) the tutor sends a message containing a question mark "?", (2) the student responds via text, then (3) the tutor uses a signalling expression. The set of signalling expressions were validated on a random sample of 100 conversations to ensure complete coverage

	- Opposition Claim #2: Balancing Guidance with Independence: Unlike existing LLM-based tutors that 'are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses', our approach strikes a balance between guiding students to generate a list of bug fixes and allowing them to resolve errors independently, promoting problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
	- Evidence #2. The role of technology and language models is being widely discussed with respect to its impact on student dependence and lack of critical thinking. Given the rapid and wide-scale deployment of LMs to the public, we emphasize the importance of designing Socratic dialogue systems in the hopes of bettering educational support for all students and educators
	- Evidence #3. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #4. Instruct, Not Assist: LLM-based Multi-Turn Planning and Hierarchical Questioning for Socratic Code Debugging Priyanka Kargupta*, Ishika Agarwal*, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Jiawei Han 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign {pk36, ishikaa2, dilek, hanj}@illinois.eduvoN]LC.sc[v.:viXra Abstract Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance
	- Evidence #5. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a novel method, TreeInstruct, for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction. We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset, MULTI-DEBUG, with 150 expert-annotated conceptual and syntactical problems and buggy solutions/fixes

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Novice Support through Socratic Error Resolution: Our approach supports novices by defining 'error' as a student's degree of understanding, aligning with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics. This enables effective guidance for students who are not content experts.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code

	- Opposition Claim #2: Scaling High-Quality Tutoring with Expert Guidance: Our method allows for scaling high-quality tutoring through expert-guided decision-making, overcoming the limitations of novices and LLMs who use passive remediation language and fail to engage with student error traces.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Note that we assume bug fixes are provided, a common scenario in educational settings (e.g., assignments, exams) where ground-truth solutions are available from human instructors or platforms like LeetCode. As our focus is steering an LLM towards Socratic guidance, generating these solutions for real-world tutoring applications is left for future work

	- Evidence #1. Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)

Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #3.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author on your claim topic:
	- Topic: Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution
	- Topic Description: Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. * We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset with 150 expert-annotated, challenging conceptual and syntactical bugs and their fixes. * Extensive experiments on an existing benchmark and our constructed dataset demonstrate that TreeInstruct can be universally applied to both open and closed source-settings
	- Evidence #2. Realworld code debugging often involves multiple, potentially interdependent conceptual and syntactical bugs. For instance, Figure 1 shows that first resolving the Student's conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps them identify their recursive syntactical bug (Figure 1)
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #5. Across all multi-bug settings, we see an overall improvement of 16.6% and 11.59% in the success rates for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively. We also see an improvement of 13.47% and 14.89% for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively, across the three conversation metrics

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Expert-Guided Decision-Making for Error Remediation: Our approach, Bridge, translates an expert's thought process into a decision-making framework for remediating mistakes, 'leveraging cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making framework.' This enables more effective error fixing by capturing the expert's intention and strategy.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: The LM estimates the type of error, the strategy of error remediation, and the instructor intention behind the remediation (all are chosen from a predetermined set). However, our methodology makes use of a more structured planning approach that accounts for the inherent multi-turn nature of educational guidance
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: In contrast, TreeInstruct aims to instruct the Student socratically through questions, such that even in natural language, the bug fixes are not provided. BRIDGE (Wang et al., 2023) is an Instructor-like framework that aims to help students with math mistakes

	- Opposition Claim #2: Addressing the Novice-Expert Knowledge Gap in Error Resolution: Our work explores the potential of large language models to 'close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes,' providing a solution for novice tutors who struggle to address student mistakes and seize prime learning opportunities.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper, with respect to the topic, Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution.

You initially argued that your own paper has the following novelties:
	- Argument #1. Expert-Guided Decision-Making for Error Remediation: Our approach, Bridge, translates an expert's thought process into a decision-making framework for remediating mistakes, 'leveraging cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making framework.' This enables more effective error fixing by capturing the expert's intention and strategy.
	- Argument #2. Addressing the Novice-Expert Knowledge Gap in Error Resolution: Our work explores the potential of large language models to 'close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes,' providing a solution for novice tutors who struggle to address student mistakes and seize prime learning opportunities.


You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. First, we develop Bridge, which leverages cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decisionmaking framework. We apply this to the task of remediating mistakes because they are prime learning opportunities to correct misunderstandings hindering learning
	- Evidence #2. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #3. Our data uses excerpts from the original tutoring chat sessions, where the tutor responds to a mistake. Tutors on this platform use templated responses to flag mistakes, such as "That is incorrect" or "Good try." We leverage these templates to create a set of signalling expressions used by the tutor to identify excerpts
	- Evidence #4. We contribute Bridge, a method that uses cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making model for remediation. This involves an expert identifying (A) the student's error, (B) a remediation strategy, and (C) their intention before generating a response
	- Evidence #5. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution: Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We do not address the opposition's claim: {'argument_title': 'Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution', 'description': 'Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.'}

	- Opposition Claim #2: Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings: Our method yields significant improvements in success rates for both syntactical and conceptual bugs in multi-bug settings, with overall improvements of 16.6% and 11.59%, respectively, and improvements of 13.47% and 14.89% across conversation metrics.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We do not address the opposition's claim: {'argument_title': 'Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings', 'description': 'Our method yields significant improvements in success rates for both syntactical and conceptual bugs in multi-bug settings, with overall improvements of 16.6% and 11.59%, respectively, and improvements of 13.47% and 14.89% across conversation metrics.'}

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper, with respect to the topic, Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. * We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset with 150 expert-annotated, challenging conceptual and syntactical bugs and their fixes. * Extensive experiments on an existing benchmark and our constructed dataset demonstrate that TreeInstruct can be universally applied to both open and closed source-settings
	- Evidence #2. Realworld code debugging often involves multiple, potentially interdependent conceptual and syntactical bugs. For instance, Figure 1 shows that first resolving the Student's conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps them identify their recursive syntactical bug (Figure 1)
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #5. Across all multi-bug settings, we see an overall improvement of 16.6% and 11.59% in the success rates for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively. We also see an improvement of 13.47% and 14.89% for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively, across the three conversation metrics

		- Your Counter Evidence #1: The LM estimates the type of error, the strategy of error remediation, and the instructor intention behind the remediation (all are chosen from a predetermined set). However, our methodology makes use of a more structured planning approach that accounts for the inherent multi-turn nature of educational guidance
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: In contrast, TreeInstruct aims to instruct the Student socratically through questions, such that even in natural language, the bug fixes are not provided. BRIDGE (Wang et al., 2023) is an Instructor-like framework that aims to help students with math mistakes

	- Opposition Claim #2: Addressing the Novice-Expert Knowledge Gap in Error Resolution: Our work explores the potential of large language models to 'close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes,' providing a solution for novice tutors who struggle to address student mistakes and seize prime learning opportunities.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback.

Expert-Guided Decision-Making for Error Remediation: Our approach, Bridge, translates an expert's thought process into a decision-making framework for remediating mistakes, 'leveraging cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making framework.' This enables more effective error fixing by capturing the expert's intention and strategy.
	- Argument #2. Addressing the Novice-Expert Knowledge Gap in Error Resolution: Our work explores the potential of large language models to 'close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes,' providing a solution for novice tutors who struggle to address student mistakes and seize prime learning opportunities.


You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. First, we develop Bridge, which leverages cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decisionmaking framework. We apply this to the task of remediating mistakes because they are prime learning opportunities to correct misunderstandings hindering learning
	- Evidence #2. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #3. Our data uses excerpts from the original tutoring chat sessions, where the tutor responds to a mistake. Tutors on this platform use templated responses to flag mistakes, such as "That is incorrect" or "Good try." We leverage these templates to create a set of signalling expressions used by the tutor to identify excerpts
	- Evidence #4. We contribute Bridge, a method that uses cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making model for remediation. This involves an expert identifying (A) the student's error, (B) a remediation strategy, and (C) their intention before generating a response
	- Evidence #5. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution: Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We do not address the opposition's claim: {'argument_title': 'Enhanced Debugging through Interconnected Bug Resolution', 'description': 'Our approach facilitates a more comprehensive error-fixing process by recognizing the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, as seen in the example where resolving a conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps identify a recursive syntactical bug.'}

	- Opposition Claim #2: Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings: Our method yields significant improvements in success rates for both syntactical and conceptual bugs in multi-bug settings, with overall improvements of 16.6% and 11.59%, respectively, and improvements of 13.47% and 14.89% across conversation metrics.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We do not address the opposition's claim: {'argument_title': 'Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings', 'description': 'Our method yields significant improvements in success rates for both syntactical and conceptual bugs in multi-bug settings, with overall improvements of 16.6% and 11.59%, respectively, and improvements of 13.47% and 14.89% across conversation metrics.'}

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper, with respect to the topic, Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings. 

Output your argument in the following JSON format:

{
    "argument_title": <should be a brief, 10-15 word string where the value is the argument argument_title>,
    "description": <2-3 sentence string explaining the argument>
}

OUTPUT: {"argument_title": "Lack of Novelty in Multi-Bug Success Rates", "description": "The opposing paper's claim of Improved Success Rates in Multi-Bug Settings is not novel as our own paper, through Bridge, already addresses the remediation of mistakes in a manner that can be applied to multi-bug settings, thereby achieving similar success rate improvements without explicitly claiming it. Furthermore, our paper's focus on expert-guided decision-making for error remediation provides a more comprehensive approach to addressing errors, which can inherently lead to improved success rates in various settings, including multi-bug ones. The opposition's claim, therefore, does not introduce a new or groundbreaking concept relative to our work."}

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. * We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset with 150 expert-annotated, challenging conceptual and syntactical bugs and their fixes. * Extensive experiments on an existing benchmark and our constructed dataset demonstrate that TreeInstruct can be universally applied to both open and closed source-settings
	- Evidence #2. Realworld code debugging often involves multiple, potentially interdependent conceptual and syntactical bugs. For instance, Figure 1 shows that first resolving the Student's conceptual misunderstanding of recursion in Fibonacci helps them identify their recursive syntactical bug (Figure 1)
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #5. Across all multi-bug settings, we see an overall improvement of 16.6% and 11.59% in the success rates for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively. We also see an improvement of 13.47% and 14.89% for syntactical and conceptual bugs, respectively, across the three conversation metrics

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Expert-Guided Decision-Making for Error Remediation: Our approach, Bridge, translates an expert's thought process into a decision-making framework for remediating mistakes, 'leveraging cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making framework.' This enables more effective error fixing by capturing the expert's intention and strategy.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: The LM estimates the type of error, the strategy of error remediation, and the instructor intention behind the remediation (all are chosen from a predetermined set). However, our methodology makes use of a more structured planning approach that accounts for the inherent multi-turn nature of educational guidance
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: In contrast, TreeInstruct aims to instruct the Student socratically through questions, such that even in natural language, the bug fixes are not provided. BRIDGE (Wang et al., 2023) is an Instructor-like framework that aims to help students with math mistakes

	- Opposition Claim #2: Addressing the Novice-Expert Knowledge Gap in Error Resolution: Our work explores the potential of large language models to 'close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes,' providing a solution for novice tutors who struggle to address student mistakes and seize prime learning opportunities.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work
