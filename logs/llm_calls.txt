PROMPT: You are a helpful assistant. You are an author of a paper that is trying to convince others of your paper's contributions towards {'argument_title': 'helping students fix their errors', 'description': 'helping students fix their errors'}.Below is a list of relevant evidence retrieved from your paper:

Retrieved Evidence #1: In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
Retrieved Evidence #2: The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
Retrieved Evidence #3: First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
Retrieved Evidence #4: Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
Retrieved Evidence #5: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

Retrieved Evidence #1: Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
Retrieved Evidence #2: Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
Retrieved Evidence #3: Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
Retrieved Evidence #4: This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
Retrieved Evidence #5: As such, our error categories are topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, and complement the topic-agnostic strategies in Step B.

PROMPT: Your objective is to check if a given evidence is relevant to a claim or not (relevancy means evidence that helps either support, refute, or clarify the given claim).
Claim: Novice tutors can be supported with topic-agnostic error categories.
Description of Claim: Our research defines error as a student's degree of understanding, using topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, which complements topic-agnostic strategies, and helps novice tutors to identify and address student mistakes.
Evidence: For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer.

This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You initially argued that your own paper has the following novelties:
	- Argument #1. Expert-guided decision-making improves novice tutors: Our approach leverages large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap. By employing expert-guided decision-making, novice tutors can seize prime learning opportunities and address student mistakes effectively, ultimately helping students fix their errors.

	- Evidence #3. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #4. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
	- Evidence #5. As such, our error categories are topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, and complement the topic-agnostic strategies in Step B. The categories are: guess: The student does not seem to understand or guessed the answer; misinterpret: The student misinterpreted the question; careless: The student made a careless mistake; right-idea: The student has the right idea, but is not quite there1; imprecise: The student's answer is not precise enough or the tutor is being too picky about the form of the student's answer; not-sure: Not sure, but I'm going to try to diagnose the student (used sparingly); N/A: None of the above (used sparingly)

	- Topic Description: Our approach helps students fix errors by guiding them to resolve their own errors through Socratic questioning, which enables them to develop a deeper understanding of the material. This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills.

Debate History:

	-You: I argue that novelty in socratic questioning approach. Our paper's contributions are novel due to the unique combination of Socratic questioning and expert-guided decision-making, which enables students to resolve errors independently and effectively. Unlike the opposing paper, our approach leverages large language models to support novice tutors in addressing student mistakes, while also providing a more comprehensive and challenging multi-bug dataset. This combination of features sets our paper apart from the opposing paper's more limited and topic-agnostic error categories.

-Opposition: I argue that novelty claim misaligned with actual contributions. The opposing paper's claimed novelty is misaligned with their actual contributions, as their approach is not fundamentally different from our own expert-guided decision-making process. Their use of Socratic questioning is merely a superficial adaptation of our approach, rather than a novel contribution. Furthermore, their approach still relies on LLMs, which are a key component of our own work, and does not address the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
	- Evidence #2. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
	- Evidence #5. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Expert-guided decision-making improves novice tutors: Our approach leverages large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap. By employing expert-guided decision-making, novice tutors can seize prime learning opportunities and address student mistakes effectively, ultimately helping students fix their errors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: Instruct, Not Assist: LLM-based Multi-Turn Planning and Hierarchical Questioning for Socratic Code Debugging Priyanka Kargupta*, Ishika Agarwal*, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Jiawei Han 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign {pk36, ishikaa2, dilek, hanj}@illinois.eduvoN]LC.sc[v.:viXra Abstract Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance

	- Opposition Claim #2: Novice tutors can be supported with topic-agnostic error categories: Our research defines error as a student's degree of understanding, using topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, which complements topic-agnostic strategies, and helps novice tutors to identify and address student mistakes.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixesall carefully constructed and annotated by experts

Based on the debate history and your/your opposition's arguments and evidence, you must construct a new, stronger argument related to the "topic".

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #2. Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
	- Evidence #3. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #4. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
	- Evidence #5. As such, our error categories are topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, and complement the topic-agnostic strategies in Step B. The categories are: guess: The student does not seem to understand or guessed the answer; misinterpret: The student misinterpreted the question; careless: The student made a careless mistake; right-idea: The student has the right idea, but is not quite there1; imprecise: The student's answer is not precise enough or the tutor is being too picky about the form of the student's answer; not-sure: Not sure, but I'm going to try to diagnose the student (used sparingly); N/A: None of the above (used sparingly)

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning: Our approach helps students fix errors by guiding them to resolve their own errors through Socratic questioning, which enables them to develop a deeper understanding of the material. This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: 4.2.2 Step B: Determine the Strategy Errors are persistent unless the teacher intervenes pedagogically with a strategy that guides the stu1This category is different from careless in that students with right-idea errors have difficulty in applying the concept correctly, whereas students with careless apply the concept correctly but make a minor numerical mistake. Process in Remediation Given a conversation history ch, we formalize the expert's responses c* r as being generated from the following computational model:c* r ~ p(cr|ch,e (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Step A , zwhat (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Step B), , zwhy (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Step C where e is the error, zwhat the strategy, and zwhy the intention

	- Opposition Claim #2: Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors that are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: To our knowledge, our work is the first to assess the performance of LLMs such as GPT4 and instruct-tuned Llama-2-70b on remediating student mistakes. We find that the response quality of LLMs significantly improve with the expert's decision-making process: Response from GPT4 with expertand self-generated decisions are 76-88% more preferred than GPT4 without
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: For example, the tutor can make the decisions and the LLM generates an initial response that is further edited by tutor. Altogether, our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author on your claim topic:
	- Topic: Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback
	- Topic Description: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors that are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
	- Evidence #2. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
	- Evidence #5. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Expert-guided decision-making improves novice tutors: Our approach leverages large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap. By employing expert-guided decision-making, novice tutors can seize prime learning opportunities and address student mistakes effectively, ultimately helping students fix their errors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work

The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance

	- Opposition Claim #2: Novice tutors can be supported with topic-agnostic error categories: Our research defines error as a student's degree of understanding, using topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, which complements topic-agnostic strategies, and helps novice tutors to identify and address student mistakes.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixesall carefully constructed and annotated by experts

	- Evidence #5. As such, our error categories are topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, and complement the topic-agnostic strategies in Step B. The categories are: guess: The student does not seem to understand or guessed the answer; misinterpret: The student misinterpreted the question; careless: The student made a careless mistake; right-idea: The student has the right idea, but is not quite there1; imprecise: The student's answer is not precise enough or the tutor is being too picky about the form of the student's answer; not-sure: Not sure, but I'm going to try to diagnose the student (used sparingly); N/A: None of the above (used sparingly)

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning: Our approach helps students fix errors by guiding them to resolve their own errors through Socratic questioning, which enables them to develop a deeper understanding of the material. This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: 4.2.2 Step B: Determine the Strategy Errors are persistent unless the teacher intervenes pedagogically with a strategy that guides the stu1This category is different from careless in that students with right-idea errors have difficulty in applying the concept correctly, whereas students with careless apply the concept correctly but make a minor numerical mistake. Process in Remediation Given a conversation history ch, we formalize the expert's responses c* r as being generated from the following computational model:c* r ~ p(cr|ch,e (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Step A , zwhat (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Step B), , zwhy (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Step C where e is the error, zwhat the strategy, and zwhy the intention

	- Opposition Claim #2: Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors that are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: To our knowledge, our work is the first to assess the performance of LLMs such as GPT4 and instruct-tuned Llama-2-70b on remediating student mistakes. We find that the response quality of LLMs significantly improve with the expert's decision-making process: Response from GPT4 with expertand self-generated decisions are 76-88% more preferred than GPT4 without
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: For example, the tutor can make the decisions and the LLM generates an initial response that is further edited by tutor. Altogether, our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap

Given the above (your initial argument, your evidence, the opposition paper's claimed points of novelty, and your counter evidence), make an argument for a specific reason why the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper, with respect to the topic, Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback.

OUTPUT: { "argument_title": "Novelty Claim Misaligned with Actual Contributions", "description": "The other paper's claimed novelty of adapting to student responses is not novel as it is a direct result of their expert-guided decision-making process, which is not a novel contribution itself. Furthermore, their approach is not significantly different from our own, as they also use LLMs to generate initial responses that are further edited by the tutor, similar to our own approach.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
	- Evidence #2. The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
	- Evidence #3. First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
	- Evidence #4. Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
	- Evidence #5. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Expert-guided decision-making improves novice tutors: Our approach leverages large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap. By employing expert-guided decision-making, novice tutors can seize prime learning opportunities and address student mistakes effectively, ultimately helping students fix their errors.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: Instruct, Not Assist: LLM-based Multi-Turn Planning and Hierarchical Questioning for Socratic Code Debugging Priyanka Kargupta*, Ishika Agarwal*, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Jiawei Han 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign {pk36, ishikaa2, dilek, hanj}@illinois.eduvoN]LC.sc[v.:viXra Abstract Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance

	- Opposition Claim #2: Novice tutors can be supported with topic-agnostic error categories: Our research defines error as a student's degree of understanding, using topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, which complements topic-agnostic strategies, and helps novice tutors to identify and address student mistakes.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixesall carefully constructed and annotated by experts

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
	- Evidence #2. Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
	- Evidence #3. Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
	- Evidence #4. This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
	- Evidence #5. As such, our error categories are topic-agnostic descriptions of a student's understanding, and complement the topic-agnostic strategies in Step B. The categories are: guess: The student does not seem to understand or guessed the answer; misinterpret: The student misinterpreted the question; careless: The student made a careless mistake; right-idea: The student has the right idea, but is not quite there1; imprecise: The student's answer is not precise enough or the tutor is being too picky about the form of the student's answer; not-sure: Not sure, but I'm going to try to diagnose the student (used sparingly); N/A: None of the above (used sparingly)

Retrieved Evidence #4: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
Retrieved Evidence #5: Overall, TreeInstruct takes a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, as (1) grounding the conversation on the state space representation ensures that all bugs are sufficiently addressed, and (2) constructing a tree based on the Student's current level of understanding allows for more relevant and personalized question generation. We summarize our contributions below: * To the best of our knowledge, TreeInstruct is the first work to explore state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction

Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work
	- Evidence #2. However, LLMs are typically optimized to generate customer-serving, assistant-like responses, which also translates into the types of questions asked. Especially for educational domains, this style of questioning can be suboptimal (Cotton, 1988; Sahamid, 2016; Yang et al., 2005; Wilson, 1987)

For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work
	- Evidence #2. However, LLMs are typically optimized to generate customer-serving, assistant-like responses, which also translates into the types of questions asked. Especially for educational domains, this style of questioning can be suboptimal (Cotton, 1988; Sahamid, 2016; Yang et al., 2005; Wilson, 1987)
	- Evidence #3. For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer
	- Evidence #4. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
	- Evidence #5. Overall, TreeInstruct takes a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, as (1) grounding the conversation on the state space representation ensures that all bugs are sufficiently addressed, and (2) constructing a tree based on the Student's current level of understanding allows for more relevant and personalized question generation. We summarize our contributions below: * To the best of our knowledge, TreeInstruct is the first work to explore state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Adapting to student responses is a key feature of our approach: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors.

While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

	- Opposition Claim #2: Our approach provides tailored feedback that improves over original tutors' responses: We measure the extent to which the generated responses improve over the original tutors' responses, and recruit teachers to perform pairwise comparisons between the tutor response and a response generated by the expert or one of the 12 models.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Evaluation with students. Our human evaluations are currently limited to the teacher's perspective
	- Evidence #2. A human tutor in-the-loop is key in catching these undesirable responses. Our work is related to human-LLM approaches that leverage expert-informed linguistic attributes (Sharma et al., 2023; Handa et al., 2023)

	- Evidence #5. By contrast, our dataset uses real experienced educators, human tutors and students from Title I schools with a need of high-dosage tutoring. Additionally, prior datasets focus on teacher strategies (e.g., "ask an open-ended question") and these strategies can often be directly observed in their responses (Stasaski et al., 2020; Caines et al., 2020; Macina et al., 2023b)

You must determine whether progress is being made. DO NOT focus on the language being used. Focus on the content of the arguments. Specifically, are these arguments sufficiently different enough to necesitate further debate? Are there new, deeper concepts being discussed between the two sets of arguments? Format the output as a schema: 
    {
        "explanation": <2-5 sentence string to explain your reasoning about whether further debate is necessary when comparing the "previous arguments" and the "current arguments">,

    }

OUTPUT: { "explanation": "Taking a closer look at both sets of arguments reveals that the second argument in both sets is talking about the effectiveness of the approaches, and both are using evaluation results to support their points. However, the first set of arguments is giving a more detailed explanation of why the current approach is more effective and is providing details about the problem of existing LLM-based tutors. The first argument is new because it is discussing a methodology and providing real examples of limitations. The second set of arguments has a very similar point that human-LLM collaboration is a novel contribution. However, both arguments only state that human-LLM collaboration is more effective than existing LLM-based tutors without providing real examples or explaining the methodology behind the collaboration. The current set of arguments is not providing new, deeper concepts that go beyond the previous arguments.", "is_expand": false}

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the "topic" are novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when generating your new, revised argument.

Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Introduction With the rapidly expanding conversational and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a substantial rise in demand for exploiting their capabilities within a multitude of educational applications (Kasneci et al., 2023) in order to widen accessibility via personalized feedback. Specifically, several recent works explore *These authors contributed equally to this work
	- Evidence #2. However, LLMs are typically optimized to generate customer-serving, assistant-like responses, which also translates into the types of questions asked. Especially for educational domains, this style of questioning can be suboptimal (Cotton, 1988; Sahamid, 2016; Yang et al., 2005; Wilson, 1987)
	- Evidence #3. For instance, if a student is seeking help from an instructor for correcting their mistakes (e.g., debugging their buggy code), we consider two forms of potential responses: assistant-like and instructor-like. As shown in Figure 1, an assistant-like response would not be a successful educational interaction, as it leads to the Assistant directly providing an answer
	- Evidence #4. We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses
	- Evidence #5. Overall, TreeInstruct takes a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, as (1) grounding the conversation on the state space representation ensures that all bugs are sufficiently addressed, and (2) constructing a tree based on the Student's current level of understanding allows for more relevant and personalized question generation. We summarize our contributions below: * To the best of our knowledge, TreeInstruct is the first work to explore state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Adapting to student responses is a key feature of our approach: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

	- Opposition Claim #2: Our approach provides tailored feedback that improves over original tutors' responses: We measure the extent to which the generated responses improve over the original tutors' responses, and recruit teachers to perform pairwise comparisons between the tutor response and a response generated by the expert or one of the 12 models.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Evaluation with students. Our human evaluations are currently limited to the teacher's perspective
	- Evidence #2. A human tutor in-the-loop is key in catching these undesirable responses. Our work is related to human-LLM approaches that leverage expert-informed linguistic attributes (Sharma et al., 2023; Handa et al., 2023)
	- Evidence #3. We measure the extent to which the generated responses improve over the original tutors' responses. We recruit teachers through Prolific (identified through Prolific's screening criteria) to perform pairwise comparisons between the tutor response and a response generated by the expert or one of the 12 models
	- Evidence #4. However, ultimately, the effectiveness of the responses relies on how students receive and interpret them, and whether these interactions positively impact their learning outcomes. To address this limitation, future research should work towards evaluating this method with students
	- Evidence #5. By contrast, our dataset uses real experienced educators, human tutors and students from Title I schools with a need of high-dosage tutoring. Additionally, prior datasets focus on teacher strategies (e.g., "ask an open-ended question") and these strategies can often be directly observed in their responses (Stasaski et al., 2020; Caines et al., 2020; Macina et al., 2023b)

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:

This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.
		- Your Counter Evidence #1: We do not address the opposition's claim: {'argument_title': 'Our approach adapts to new student responses through state space estimation', 'description': "Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses by estimating the state space representation, ensuring that all bugs are sufficiently addressed. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses."}

We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and find that the expert's decisionmaking model is critical for LLMs to close the gap: responses from GPT4 with expert decisions (e.g., "simplify the problem") are +76% more preferred than without
		- Your Counter Evidence #2: For example, the tutor can make the decisions and the LLM generates an initial response that is further edited by tutor. Altogether, our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap

OUTPUT: {"explanation": "Comparing the content of the previous and current arguments, we see that similar topics and concepts are still being discussed: the novelty of dynamic tree-based models, the blending of human and LLM guidance. However, we notice that the depth of inspection of these topics has increased, with the current arguments more clearly articulating the distinctions between the two approaches and their implications for scalability and generalizability. Yet, the primary points of contention appear to remain the same. Two questions are raised: (1) are the two approaches equally effective in bridging the knowledge gap? And, (2) are the dynamic tree-based models derived from the current state-of-the-art Socratic instruction methods? Additionally, both sets of arguments do not provide evidence that new points of contention can be resolved through further debate. In other words, it does not seem that there are new, more refined arguments that can be brought into the discussion to provide increased insights or fundamentally alter the current debate. Therefore, based on the depth of inspection of fundamental arguments and the opportunity to develop new points of contention, progress is still being made but it is marginal.", "is_expand": true}

Retrieved Evidence #2: Figure 2: We propose TreeInstruct, a novel tree-guided instructional questioning framework for meaningful educational debugging guidance. 3 Methodology As shown in Figure 2, TreeInstruct aims to dynamically guide the multi-turn conversation based on its estimated state space
Retrieved Evidence #3: To tackle these challenges, we propose TreeInstruct based on the following principles: 1. State space estimation: An Instructor plans its conversation with a Student based on the "distance" between their initial answer and the optimal, correct answer within the estimated state space
Retrieved Evidence #4: 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a novel method, TreeInstruct, for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction. We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset, MULTI-DEBUG, with 150 expert-annotated conceptual and syntactical problems and buggy solutions/fixes
Retrieved Evidence #5: TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixesall carefully constructed and annotated by experts

This is a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with existing LLL-based tutors.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the topic are not novel relative to your own paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You initially argued that your own paper has the following novelties:
	- Argument #1. Expert-informed decision-making enhances LLMs: Expert-informed decision-making is critical for LLMs to generate effective responses. By leveraging expert-informed linguistic attributes, our approach can close the knowledge gap between novices and experts, as seen in the +76% increase in preferred responses when GPT4 is provided with expert decisions.
	- Argument #2.

	- Evidence #3. Context-sensitive decisions are also critical to closing the knowledge gap: Random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality -67% than expert decisions. Complementing our quantitative analysis, our lexical analysis reveals that novices and LLMs without the expert's decision-making process engage superficially with student's problemsolving process: They give away the answer or prompt the student to re-attempt without further guidance ("double check", "try again")
	- Evidence #4. Additionally, context-sensitive decisions are critical to closing pedagogical gaps: random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality by -97% than expert decisions. Our work shows the potential of embedding expert thought processes in LLM generations to enhance their capability to bridge novice-expert knowledge gaps
	- Evidence #5. For example, the tutor can make the decisions and the LLM generates an initial response that is further edited by tutor. Altogether, our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap

This distinction is critical as it enables our approach to address both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently, which is not possible with expert-informed decision-making. Furthermore, our paper's contributions are not built upon the opposition's foundational work, but rather introduce a novel approach to multi-turn conversational feedback that is not explored in the opposition paper.
	-Opposition: While the distinction between state space estimation and tree-based questioning is acknowledged, it is still unclear how these methods are novel and not a rehashing of existing ideas. Furthermore, the opposition's own results show that expert decisions are critical for effective LLM responses, which suggests that their approach is not as distinct from our own as they claim. The opposition must provide more evidence to demonstrate the true novelty of their approach.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. A human tutor in-the-loop is key in catching these undesirable responses. Our work is related to human-LLM approaches that leverage expert-informed linguistic attributes (Sharma et al., 2023; Handa et al., 2023)
	- Evidence #2. We construct a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and find that the expert's decisionmaking model is critical for LLMs to close the gap: responses from GPT4 with expert decisions (e.g., "simplify the problem") are +76% more preferred than without
	- Evidence #3. Context-sensitive decisions are also critical to closing the knowledge gap: Random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality -67% than expert decisions. Complementing our quantitative analysis, our lexical analysis reveals that novices and LLMs without the expert's decision-making process engage superficially with student's problemsolving process: They give away the answer or prompt the student to re-attempt without further guidance ("double check", "try again")
	- Evidence #4. Additionally, context-sensitive decisions are critical to closing pedagogical gaps: random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality by -97% than expert decisions. Our work shows the potential of embedding expert thought processes in LLM generations to enhance their capability to bridge novice-expert knowledge gaps
	- Evidence #5. For example, the tutor can make the decisions and the LLM generates an initial response that is further edited by tutor. Altogether, our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap

You also had preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Our approach provides a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback: Our approach constructs a tree based on the student's current level of understanding, allowing for more relevant and personalized question generation. This is a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with existing LLL-based tutors.

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author on your claim topic:
	- Topic: Our approach enables personalized question generation through dynamic tree-based questioning
	- Topic Description: Our approach constructs a tree based on the student's current level of understanding, allowing for more relevant and personalized question generation. This is a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with existing LLL-based tutors.

Your debate claim is that your paper's contributions towards the topic are all novel relative to the other paper. Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.

You used the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. Overall, TreeInstruct takes a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, as (1) grounding the conversation on the state space representation ensures that all bugs are sufficiently addressed, and (2) constructing a tree based on the Student's current level of understanding allows for more relevant and personalized question generation. We summarize our contributions below: * To the best of our knowledge, TreeInstruct is the first work to explore state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction
	- Evidence #2. Figure 2: We propose TreeInstruct, a novel tree-guided instructional questioning framework for meaningful educational debugging guidance. 3 Methodology As shown in Figure 2, TreeInstruct aims to dynamically guide the multi-turn conversation based on its estimated state space
	- Evidence #3. To tackle these challenges, we propose TreeInstruct based on the following principles: 1. State space estimation: An Instructor plans its conversation with a Student based on the "distance" between their initial answer and the optimal, correct answer within the estimated state space
	- Evidence #4. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a novel method, TreeInstruct, for state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction. We construct a novel multi-bug debugging dataset, MULTI-DEBUG, with 150 expert-annotated conceptual and syntactical problems and buggy solutions/fixes
	- Evidence #5. TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixesall carefully constructed and annotated by experts

You also have preemptively collected some counter evidence from your own paper based on the opposing author's claimed points of novelty:
	- Opposition Claim #1: Expert-informed decision-making enhances LLMs: Expert-informed decision-making is critical for LLMs to generate effective responses. By leveraging expert-informed linguistic attributes, our approach can close the knowledge gap between novices and experts, as seen in the +76% increase in preferred responses when GPT4 is provided with expert decisions.

By leveraging expert-informed linguistic attributes, our approach can close the knowledge gap between novices and experts, as seen in the +76% increase in preferred responses when GPT4 is provided with expert decisions.'}

	- Opposition Claim #2: Dynamic tree-based questioning fosters deeper engagement: Our approach constructs a tree based on the student's current level of understanding, allowing for more relevant and personalized question generation. This leads to a deeper engagement with the student's problem-solving process, as opposed to superficial engagement where the LLM gives away the answer or prompts the student to re-attempt without further guidance.

	-Opposition: I argue that lack of novelty in dynamic tree-based questioning. The other paper's approach to dynamic tree-based questioning is not novel as it does not address the critical role of expert-informed decision-making in closing the knowledge gap between novices and experts. Our own paper has shown that expert-informed decision-making is essential for LLMs to generate effective responses, and our approach constructs a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions, which evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and finds that the expert's decision-making model is critical for LLMs to close the gap: responses from GPT4 with expert decisions (e.g.,

PROMPT: You are an author of a paper that is debating another author.

Your debate claim is that the other paper's contributions towards the "topic" are not novel relative to your own paper's contributions towards the "topic". Refer to their arguments and presented evidence, as well as your own paper's segments as evidence when refining your arguments.Use the following evidence to support your arguments:
	- Evidence #1. A human tutor in-the-loop is key in catching these undesirable responses. Our work is related to human-LLM approaches that leverage expert-informed linguistic attributes (Sharma et al., 2023; Handa et al., 2023)
	- Evidence #2. We construct a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and find that the expert's decisionmaking model is critical for LLMs to close the gap: responses from GPT4 with expert decisions (e.g., "simplify the problem") are +76% more preferred than without
	- Evidence #3. Context-sensitive decisions are also critical to closing the knowledge gap: Random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality -67% than expert decisions. Complementing our quantitative analysis, our lexical analysis reveals that novices and LLMs without the expert's decision-making process engage superficially with student's problemsolving process: They give away the answer or prompt the student to re-attempt without further guidance ("double check", "try again")
	- Evidence #4. Additionally, context-sensitive decisions are critical to closing pedagogical gaps: random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality by -97% than expert decisions. Our work shows the potential of embedding expert thought processes in LLM generations to enhance their capability to bridge novice-expert knowledge gaps
	- Evidence #5. For example, the tutor can make the decisions and the LLM generates an initial response that is further edited by tutor. Altogether, our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap

PROMPT: The authors of two papers have debated about the similarities and differences between their papers. Author 0 is the author of the main paper, while Author 1 is the author of the paper being compared to the main paper. Below, you are given the "conversation_history" between the authors, and the specific similarities and differences. The similarities and differences are from the point-of-view of Author 0.

"conversation_history":
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning
	- Topic Description: Our approach helps students fix errors by guiding them to resolve their own errors through Socratic questioning, which enables them to develop a deeper understanding of the material. This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in socratic questioning approach. Our paper's contributions are novel due to the unique combination of Socratic questioning and expert-guided decision-making, which enables students to resolve errors independently and effectively. Unlike the opposing paper, our approach leverages large language models to support novice tutors in addressing student mistakes, while also providing a more comprehensive and challenging multi-bug dataset. This combination of features sets our paper apart from the opposing paper's more limited and topic-agnostic error categories.
	-Author 1: I argue that novelty claim misaligned with actual contributions. The opposing paper's claimed novelty is misaligned with their actual contributions, as their approach is not fundamentally different from our own expert-guided decision-making process. Their use of Socratic questioning is merely a superficial adaptation of our approach, rather than a novel contribution. Furthermore, their approach still relies on LLMs, which are a key component of our own work, and does not address the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors.

	-Author 0: While the opposition acknowledges our use of Socratic questioning, they fail to recognize the significance of our multi-bug dataset, which is a novel contribution that allows for more comprehensive error resolution. This dataset is not a superficial adaptation, but rather a crucial component that sets our approach apart from the opposition's. Furthermore, our use of LLMs is not a direct copy, but rather a novel application that enables novice tutors to effectively address student mistakes.
	-Author 1: While the opposition highlights the significance of their multi-bug dataset, I argue that it is still a derivative of our own work, as it is based on the same error categories and knowledge gap that our approach addresses. Furthermore, their novel application of LLMs is still limited by the same knowledge gap, and does not provide a fundamental shift in the way novice tutors address student mistakes. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying knowledge gap, which our paper provides.

	-Author 0: I argue that novel socratic questioning approach combines expert guidance and multi-bug dataset. Our paper's novelty lies in its unique combination of Socratic questioning and expert-guided decision-making, supported by a comprehensive multi-bug dataset. This approach enables students to resolve errors independently and effectively, addressing the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors. By leveraging LLMs to support novice tutors, our approach provides a fundamental shift in the way student mistakes are addressed.
	-Author 1: I argue that expert-guided human-llm approach overcomes limitations of novice tutors and socratic questioning alone. Our paper's contributions are novel due to the expert-guided human-LLM approach that bridges the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors, providing a more effective and comprehensive solution to guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning. This approach overcomes the limitations of novice tutors and Socratic questioning alone, enabling students to develop a deeper understanding of the material and resolve errors independently. Our results demonstrate the promising potential of this approach in scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making.
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback
	- Topic Description: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors that are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback. Our paper's contributions are novel due to its unique approach to traversing the space using Socratic questions and tracing variables, which is not present in the opposing paper. This approach allows for effective adaptation to new student responses and provision of tailored feedback, making it a significant improvement over existing LLM-based tutors. Furthermore, our paper's use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes provides a more challenging and realistic testing ground for our approach.
	-Author 1: I argue that novelty claim misaligned with actual contributions. The other paper's claimed novelty of adapting to student responses is not novel as it is a direct result of their expert-guided decision-making process, which is not a novel contribution itself. Furthermore, their approach is not significantly different from our own, as they also use LLMs to generate initial responses that are further edited by the tutor, similar to our own approach. This suggests that their claimed novelty is not a distinct contribution, but rather a natural extension of their own approach.

	-Author 0: While the opposition claims that our approach is not novel due to its reliance on expert-guided decision-making, I argue that this process is unique in its ability to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback through the use of Socratic questions and variable tracing, which is not present in their approach. Furthermore, our use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes provides a more challenging and realistic testing ground for our approach, which is not accounted for in the opposition's paper. This highlights the distinct contributions of our paper in the field of adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback.
	-Author 1: While the opposition acknowledges the use of Socratic questions and variable tracing, they fail to address the fact that these methods are not novel contributions, but rather a natural extension of their own approach. Furthermore, the use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes, while beneficial, does not necessarily imply that their approach is more novel than ours. In fact, our approach has been shown to be effective in adapting to new student responses and providing tailored feedback, which is not explicitly demonstrated in the opposition's paper.

	-Author 0: I argue that adapting to student responses with novel socratic questioning and variable tracing. Our paper's contributions towards adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback are novel due to its unique approach to traversing the space using Socratic questions and tracing variables, which is not present in the opposing paper. This approach allows for effective adaptation to new student responses and provision of tailored feedback, making it a significant improvement over existing LLM-based tutors. Furthermore, our paper's use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes provides a more challenging and realistic testing ground for our approach, highlighting its distinct contributions in the field.
	-Author 1: I argue that novel expert-guided llm approach bridges knowledge gap in adapting to student responses. Our paper's contributions are novel due to its expert-guided LLM approach that effectively adapts to student responses and provides tailored feedback, outperforming existing LLM-based tutors. This approach is distinct from the opposition's, which relies on Socratic questioning and variable tracing, but lacks the guidance of an expert. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in bridging the knowledge gap, making it a significant contribution to the field.
Debate Topic Information:
	- Topic: Our approach adapts to new student responses through state space estimation
	- Topic Description: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses by estimating the state space representation, ensuring that all bugs are sufficiently addressed.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in state space estimation for adaptive tutoring. Our paper's contributions are novel due to the unique integration of state space estimation with Socratic questioning, allowing for a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses. In contrast, the opposing paper's approach is limited to adapting to new student responses without a structured framework, making our contributions more comprehensive and impactful.
	-Author 1: I argue that the other paper's state space estimation is not novel. The other paper's state space estimation is not novel because it does not address the limitations of existing LLM-based tutors. Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses. Furthermore, our evaluation with students shows that our approach is more effective than existing LLM-based tutors, as measured by the extent to which the generated responses improve over the original tutors' responses.

	-Author 0: While the opposing paper's approach does demonstrate adaptability to new student responses, it is still limited by its reliance on LLM-based tutors, which do not provide a structured framework for state space estimation. In contrast, our paper's unique integration of state space estimation with Socratic questioning provides a more comprehensive and structured approach to adaptive tutoring, as evident in our traversal of the space and resolution of variables based on student responses. Furthermore, our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving student learning outcomes.
	-Author 1: While the opposition's approach may provide a structured framework for state space estimation, it is still unclear how this framework addresses the limitations of existing LLM-based tutors. In fact, our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing LLM-based tutors, as measured by the extent to which the generated responses improve over the original tutors' responses. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on LLM-based tutors, but rather uses a more adaptive and dynamic method to traverse the space and resolve variables based on student responses.

	-Author 0: I argue that novelty in state space estimation for adaptive tutoring through structured socratic questioning. Our approach is the first to integrate state space estimation with Socratic questioning, providing a more comprehensive and structured approach to adaptive tutoring. This integration enables our approach to address the limitations of existing LLM-based tutors, which are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. By traversing the space using Socratic questions and tracing which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses, our approach ensures that all bugs are sufficiently addressed, making it a novel contribution to the field of adaptive tutoring.
	-Author 1: I argue that our approach is more effective and novel in adaptive tutoring through human-llm collaboration. Our paper's contributions are novel because our human-LLM collaboration approach is more effective than existing LLM-based tutors in improving student learning outcomes. This is evident in our evaluation results, which demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing LLM-based tutors. Furthermore, our approach is more comprehensive and structured than existing LLM-based tutors, as it uses a dynamic method to traverse the space and resolve variables based on student responses, and is not limited by the direct revelation of code answers or inability to adapt to new student responses.

This is distinct from the opposition paper's approach, which relies on adapting to student responses and improving over original tutors' responses. Furthermore, our approach is the first to explore state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for multi-turn Socratic instruction.
	-Author 1: I argue that the opposition's tree-based questioning is not novel relative to our expert-guided human-llm approach. The opposition's tree-based questioning is not novel relative to our expert-guided human-LLM approach, as our work shows promising results of an expert-guided human-LLM approach that makes strides towards bridging the knowledge gap. Our evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations also demonstrates that the expert's decisionmaking model is critical for LLMs to close the gap. Furthermore, our approach constructs a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions, which is not possible with the opposition's tree-based questioning.

	-Author 0: While the opposition acknowledges the novelty of our state space estimation and tree-based questioning, they fail to address the core contribution of our work. Our approach is distinct in that it provides a structured and more scalable method for multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with the opposition's expert-guided human-LLM approach. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, which may not be generalizable to other domains or populations.
	-Author 1: I acknowledge the opposition's point about scalability, but I argue that our expert-guided human-LLM approach is more generalizable to other domains or populations due to its adaptability to the student's current level of understanding. Furthermore, our approach's reliance on a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations allows for a more nuanced understanding of the student's knowledge gaps, which is not possible with the opposition's state space estimation and tree-based questioning. I would like to clarify, does the opposition's approach account for the student's current level of understanding in the tree-based questioning process?

This is a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with existing LLL-based tutors.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that our contributions are novel due to state space estimation and tree-based questioning. Our paper introduces a novel approach to multi-turn conversational feedback through state space estimation and tree-based questioning, which is not explored in the opposition paper. This structured approach allows for more relevant and personalized question generation, addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently. In contrast, the opposition paper's approach relies on expert-informed decision-making, which may not be applicable in all scenarios.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in structured feedback approach. The other paper's structured feedback approach is not novel as it relies on expert-informed decision-making, which is a key component of our own approach. Our work demonstrates the critical role of expert-informed decision-making in closing the knowledge gap between novices and experts, and our results show that expert decisions are essential for effective LLM responses. Therefore, the other paper's structured feedback approach is not novel as it is built upon our foundational work.

	-Author 0: While the opposition acknowledges that our structured feedback approach is novel, they fail to address the key distinction between our state space estimation and tree-based questioning. This distinction is critical as it enables our approach to address both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently, which is not possible with expert-informed decision-making. Furthermore, our paper's contributions are not built upon the opposition's foundational work, but rather introduce a novel approach to multi-turn conversational feedback that is not explored in the opposition paper.
	-Author 1: While the distinction between state space estimation and tree-based questioning is acknowledged, it is still unclear how these methods are novel and not a rehashing of existing ideas. Furthermore, the opposition's own results show that expert decisions are critical for effective LLM responses, which suggests that their approach is not as distinct from our own as they claim. The opposition must provide more evidence to demonstrate the true novelty of their approach.

	-Author 0: I argue that treeinstruct's novel state space estimation and tree-based questioning foster meaningful educational debugging guidance. Our paper introduces a novel approach to multi-turn conversational feedback through state space estimation and tree-based questioning, which is not explored in the opposition paper. This structured approach allows for more relevant and personalized question generation, addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently. In contrast, the opposition paper's approach relies on expert-informed decision-making, which may not be applicable in all scenarios.
	-Author 1: I argue that expert-informed decision-making is critical for effective llm responses, rendering other approaches less novel. Our work demonstrates the critical role of expert-informed decision-making in closing the knowledge gap between novices and experts. By leveraging expert decisions, we show that LLM responses can be significantly improved, making expert-informed decision-making a crucial component of effective LLM-based tutoring systems. This renders other approaches, such as state space estimation and tree-based questioning, less novel and less effective in bridging the knowledge gap.

This is a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with existing LLL-based tutors.

Debate History:

	-Author 0: I argue that our contributions are novel due to state space estimation and tree-based questioning. Our paper introduces a novel approach to state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning, which is not present in the opposing paper. This allows for more relevant and personalized question generation, addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting. In contrast, the opposing paper focuses on expert-informed decision-making and superficial engagement, which are not novel contributions to the topic.
	-Author 1: I argue that lack of novelty in dynamic tree-based questioning. The other paper's approach to dynamic tree-based questioning is not novel as it does not address the critical role of expert-informed decision-making in closing the knowledge gap between novices and experts. Our own paper has shown that expert-informed decision-making is essential for LLMs to generate effective responses, and our approach constructs a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions, which evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and finds that the expert's decision-making model is critical for LLMs to close the gap: responses from GPT4 with expert decisions (e.g., 

	-Author 0: While the opposing paper emphasizes the importance of expert-informed decision-making, we argue that our novel state space estimation and tree-based questioning approach can be applied to any domain, without requiring expert-informed decision-making. Our approach can adapt to the student's current level of understanding, making it more flexible and scalable than the opposing paper's approach. Furthermore, our paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of our approach on a diverse set of domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating personalized questions.
	-Author 1: While the opposition acknowledges the importance of expert-informed decision-making, they fail to address the critical issue of knowledge gap closure between novices and experts. Our own paper has shown that expert-informed decision-making is essential for LLMs to close this gap, and our approach constructs a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions, which evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and finds that the expert's decision-making model is critical for LLMs to close the gap. This is not addressed in the opposition's approach, which may be flexible and scalable but lacks the critical component of expert-informed decision-making.

	-Author 0: I argue that novel state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for personalized educational debugging. Our paper presents a novel approach to state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning for personalized educational debugging, addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting. This approach is more structured and flexible than existing LLL-based tutors, allowing for more relevant and personalized question generation. In contrast, the opposing paper's approach relies on expert-informed decision-making, which is not novel and may not be applicable to all domains.
	-Author 1: I argue that expert-informed decision-making is crucial for closing knowledge gaps in dynamic tree-based questioning. Our paper's emphasis on expert-informed decision-making is novel and essential for closing the knowledge gap between novices and experts in dynamic tree-based questioning. Unlike the opposition's approach, which relies on state space estimation and tree-based questioning alone, our approach incorporates expert-informed decision-making to generate effective responses. This critical component is missing in the opposition's approach, rendering their contributions less novel and impactful.


"similarities": helping students fix their errors: helping students fix their errors.,Adapting to student responses and providing tailored feedback: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses and provide tailored feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors that are prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new student responses. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses..,Our approach provides tailored feedback through dynamic tree-based questioning: Our approach constructs a tree based on the student's current level of understanding, allowing for more relevant and personalized question generation. This is a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback, which is not possible with existing LLM-based tutors..

"differences": Guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning: Our approach helps students fix errors by guiding them to resolve their own errors through Socratic questioning, which enables them to develop a deeper understanding of the material. This is evident in the way the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student, directing them towards where their mistake is and using natural language to describe the bug fixes, allowing the Student to learn from their mistakes and develop problem-solving skills..,Our approach adapts to new student responses through state space estimation: Our approach is able to adapt to new student responses by estimating the state space representation, ensuring that all bugs are sufficiently addressed. This is evident in the way we traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the student's responses..,Our approach provides a more structured approach to multi-turn conversational feedback: Our approach constructs a tree based on the student's current level of understanding, allowing for more relevant and personalized question generation.

Your task is to write a synthesis of the debate that summarizes the similarities and differences between the papers. Focus more on the differences than the similarities. Format the output as a schema:
    {
        "summary": <5-10 sentence string to summarize the similarities and differences between the two papesr>
    }

OUTPUT: { "summary": "The debate between Author 0 and Author 1 centered around the similarities and differences between their two papers, which focused on guiding students to resolve errors through Socratic questioning and adapting to student responses. One of the main points of contention was the novelty of their approaches, with Author 0 claiming that their paper introduced a unique combination of Socratic questioning and expert-guided decision-making, while Author 1 argued that their approach was not novel. Author 0 emphasized that their paper's use of a multi-bug dataset and expert-annotated bug fixes provided a more challenging and realistic testing ground for their approach, while Author 1 countered that their approach was more effective in bridging the knowledge gap between novice and expert tutors. Another difference between the papers was the approach to providing tailored feedback, with Author 0's paper using a dynamic tree-based questioning approach and Author 1's paper using an expert-guided human-LLM approach. Author 0 argued that their approach was more structured and scalable than Author 1's, while Author 1 countered that their approach was more effective in generating effective responses. Overall, the debate highlighted the differences between the two papers, with Author 0 emphasizing the novelty and effectiveness of their approach, and Author 1 arguing that their approach was more generalizable and adaptable to different domains." }
