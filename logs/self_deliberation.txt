True paper:
0.74969881772995 - In their "Help Fix Code" and "Question from Code" modules, the Instructor provides single-turn responses to the Student for answering questions, explaining concepts, and helping to write code. However, these modules direct the Student towards where their mistake is and uses natural language to describe the bug fixes
0.7473180890083313 - The Instructor guides the Student to generate a list of all bug fixes based on their interactions with the Instructor. The overall goal is for the Student to resolve their own conceptual and syntactical errors in a Socratic fashion to reach the correct code
0.743821918964386 - First, we use the Socratic Debugging Benchmark dataset from (Al-Hossami et al., 2023b), which consists of 149 problemseach with a problem statement, student buggy code, bug fixes and descriptions in English, and correct code. However, these problems lack sufficient difficulty, often requiring small fixes and minimal problem comprehension
0.7423090934753418 - Suppose the student is missing a base case and incorrectly calling the recursive function. Solving one bug requires adequate understanding of the other, thereby making it easier to solve
0.7416804432868958 - We traverse the space using Socratic questions and trace which variables have been resolved, grounded based on the Student's responses. While existing LLM-based tutors are effective in fixing the Student's code with high success, they are either prone to directly revealing code answers or cannot be adapted to new Student responses

Develop Arguments:

True paper:
Argument #1 - Guiding Students to Resolve Errors Socratically.
	Our approach guides students to generate a list of bug fixes and resolve errors through Socratic questioning, enabling them to understand and correct their mistakes independently. This method helps students develop problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding.
Argument #2 - Contextualizing Error Fixes through Interconnected Bug Resolution.
	Our approach recognizes the interconnectedness of errors, making it easier for students to solve one bug by understanding the relationship with another, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive error-fixing process.

False paper:
0.7859837412834167 - Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes
0.7753070592880249 - Our approach intends to support novices who are not necessarily content experts. Therefore we define "error" as a student's degree of understanding, which aligns with literature on math curriculum design and psychometrics that maintain continuous scales of student understanding (Gagne, 1962, 1968; White, 1973; Resnick et al., 1973; Glaser and Nitko, 1970; Vygotsky and Cole, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Embretson and Reise, 2013)
0.7685800790786743 - Novices and LLMs alone use passive remediation language and do not engage with the student's error traces. Our findings indicate promising avenues for scaling high-quality tutoring with expert-guided decision-making
0.7539766430854797 - This resulted in Step A: Infer the student's error to answer the first question. Experts used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding
0.7357894778251648 - rpA]LC.sc[v.:viXra Bridging the Novice-Expert Gap via Models of Decision-Making: A Case Study on Remediating Math Mistakes Rose E. Wang Qingyang Zhang Carly Robinson Susanna Loeb Dorottya Demszky Stanford University rewang@cs.stanford.edu, ddemszky@stanford.edu Abstract Scaling high-quality tutoring remains a major challenge in education

Develop Arguments:

False paper:
Argument #1 - Addressing Novice Tutor Knowledge Gap.
	Our work explores the potential of large language models to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes, thus helping students fix their errors. This is particularly important due to the growing demand for online tutoring platforms that often employ novice tutors.
Argument #2 - Engaging Error Remediation Techniques.
	Experts in our study used several techniques to engage with the student's error, such as asking questions and simplifying the problem to meet the student's level of understanding, providing a more effective approach to helping students fix their errors.
