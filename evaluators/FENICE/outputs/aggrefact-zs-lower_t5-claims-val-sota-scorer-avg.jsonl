A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite.

'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.'

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video . An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday . The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color . The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization.

A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury.

{"dataset": "SummEval", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Sick of awkward father-daughter portraits? Well one photographer has found an effective - if a little odd - way of making them more interesting. Japanese photographer Y\u00fbki Aoyama's latest series of images capture po-faced teenagers pictured next to their fathers leaping into the air. In each picture the daughter looks directly into the camera smiling while her father pulls a dramatic pose. A series of images by photographer\u00a0Y\u00fbki Aoyama sees fathers leaping into the air next to their daughters . The images are from the 37-year-old's latest book which roughly translates into Daughter and Salary Man. According to the \u00a0photographer's website\u00a0the images allow the father who usually has to act serious to express his fun side by being 'a hero jumping the sky, enfold(ing) strong excitement and hope.' Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit.

Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit.

A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the\u00a0Dallas Morning News.

At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her.

The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video . The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico . 'There's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river (200m away) which runs out to the sea and the marina,' Mr Weston explained. 'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system. Guess that's nature though,' he said. In the video the beast glides through the water, with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other, as crowds gasp in amazement.

New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video . The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico .

'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system.

{"dataset": "SummEval", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019", "text": "nathan hughes's knee collided with george north's head as he scored a try for northampton at franklin's gardens on march 27 . hughes was initially suspended for three matches after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been 'reckless' hughes's red card has now been officially rescinded .", "id": "81bd721b16cad47dfd8d24baca5b30b006291db2", "label": "1", "model_name": "T5", "text_claims": ["Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head.", "He scored a try for Northampton at Frank Lloyd's Gardens on March 27.", "Hughes was initially suspended for three matches.", "A disciplinary panel ruled he had been'reckless'.", "Hughes's red card has now been officially rescinded."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9775362014770508}}

North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019", "text": "nathan hughes's knee collided with george north's head as he crossed the line to score a try for northampton on march 27 . north was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident .", "id": "81bd721b16cad47dfd8d24baca5b30b006291db2", "label": "1", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head.", "Nathan Hughes crossed the line to score a try for Northampton on March 27.", "North was left unconscious by the clash.", "A third blow to the head occurred in the space of two months.", "Hughes was sent off.", "Hughes was banned for three weeks following the incident."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9993713398774465}}

Hart has labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' 'I\u2019ve got a lot more learning to do and I want to do it in this team. '[Buffon\u2019s caps total] is a long way off, but it\u2019s definitely a night to celebrate a terrific goalkeeper and a legend of the game, someone I personally look up to and it\u2019s inspirational to see.' The Manchester City shot stopper, who is 10 years younger than Buffon, revealed his delight at receiving his 50th cap at the Juventus Stadium. 'I was proud of my first cap, I was proud to represent the Under 21s, and 50 caps at my age is good,' added Hart. 'I want to keep going, that\u2019s not the end for me. I just want to keep going, keep playing well for my club and country and rack them up.'

Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas . Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.'

Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth.

{"dataset": "SummEval", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

{"dataset": "SummEval", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut.

{"dataset": "SummEval", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise)\u00a0Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and\u00a0Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write.

Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise)\u00a0Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and\u00a0Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'", "text": "fa chairman greg dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 . the proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in england for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . graham taylor, glenn hoddle, kevin keegan, sven-goran eriksson and steve mcclaren have signed a letter addressed to dyke .", "id": "d680ebcdcd59fd5ee9b602a06bcd5230c212835b", "label": "1", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["FA chairman Greg Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12.", "The proposals also include changing the rules.", "'Home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21.", "Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve Mcclaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9906000196933746}}

Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer . Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory . 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer .

The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club\u00a0president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer . Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory . 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements.

In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence . Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who \u00a0was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history . The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology.

Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.", "text": "In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence .

An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.'

Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard)\u00a0was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother.

Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.'

A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. \"This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,\" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. \"It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts.\" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong.

He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said.

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers.

'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results.

His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory \u2013 or a loss \u2013 could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

Katherine\u2019s voice had to be most haunting in its delivery.\u2019 The director also paid tribute to the late actor\u2019s sense of humour and noted that his onscreen chemistry was quickly established with Keniheart on account of the pair discovering that they had both had similar, difficult pasts.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "They are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across America, prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on Earth they could mean and where they are pointing to. But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington,\u00a0Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing\u00a0Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda,\u00a0Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow\u00a0town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com\u00a0so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us.

The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges.

Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze\u2019s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra \u00a32,100 a year \u2013 \u00a317,800 rather than \u00a315,700 \u2013 to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages \u00a322,100, Prudential\u2019s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that \u00a39,500 \u2013 the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday\u2019s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse\u2019s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce \u2013 usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse \u2013 does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through \u2018pension-splitting\u2019 arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: \u2018Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. \u2018A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. \u2018During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people\u2019s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.\u2019 The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.", "text": "people who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 % higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce . it means an extra \u00a3 2,100 a year -- \u00a3 17,800 rather than \u00a3 15,700 . one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts .", "id": "068f529825cc39af930a462c5e9685cbd7961fa5", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 % higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce.", "It means an extra \u00a3 2,100 a year -- \u00a3 17,800 rather than \u00a3 15,700.", "One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9981985886891683}}
{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock\u2019s permanent manager on Friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season. An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday \u2018I\u2019d be over the moon to get it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked hard towards,\u2019 said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. \u2018I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. \u2018I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. \u2018I\u2019ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. \u2018Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I\u2019ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. \u2018There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.\u2019 Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock \u2014 Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O\u2019Hara \u2014 who will become free agents this summer. \u2018I\u2019ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. \u2018You can\u2019t do that until you are the main man.\u2019", "text": "gary locke will be confirmed as kilmarnock 's permanent manager on friday . locke replaced allan johnston on a caretaker basis in february . the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman jim mann since taking charge .", "id": "008aa71f64621995d749aff42be822b1b6ca7bc9", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock's permanent manager on Friday.", "Locke replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February.", "The 39-year-old paid tribute to the players.", "His efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since taking charge."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9734772741794586}}
{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

Iraqi officials said Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri had died in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup.\u00a0Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kurdistan, which has managed to insulate itself from the worst of the violence afflicting the rest of Iraq.

This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies.

At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously.

Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali,\u00a0- \u00a0the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.'

Her first marriage took place in 1999, with most recent being in 2010 Barrientos' marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril The bride and her grooms: This map shows Barrientos' marriages from 1999 to 2010 Barrientos' first marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril, followed by a 2001 marriage to Ahmed Allam, then a second 2001 marriage to Habibur Rahman, the Post reported. According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents,\u00a0The New York Daily News\u00a0said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.' The newspaper reported that Barrientos could be sentenced to a total of eight years stemming from her two charges. Barrientos has been arrested multiple times, including for loitering, drug possession, and jumping a turnstile and trespassing, according to the Daily News. Mystery: The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office told the New York Times According to the New York Times, '[Barrientos] has divorced at least four times, from husbands Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7, but long after marrying husbands 3 through 9.' The Times reported that for her first three 2002 marriages, Barrientos wed Koridze on Valentine's Day, before she went on to marry Goktepe approximately two weeks later, then soon tied the knot with Paharelau. The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office revealed to the Times. Barrientos' Facebook profile says she hails from the Dominican Republic and lives in Manhattan. It also says she became engaged in July 2013. Wedding bells?

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Birmingham is the rat capital of the UK and the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs, according to new research. The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem", "text": "newcastle is the most pest-infested place in the uk with 5 % of residents reporting problems with rats , cockroaches , wasps and other creepy crawlies . london borough of southwark has the most mice and bed bugs , according to british pest control association . birmingham topped the league table for rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014 .", "id": "b6f33db2b8ff0a48d8ff0e7e2aa8116be35c50e7", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Newcastle is the most pest-infested place in the UK.", "5 % of residents report problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies.", "London Borough of Southwark has the most mice and bed bugs.", "The statistics were provided by the British Pest Control Association.", "Birmingham topped the league table for rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9985238313674927}}
{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Economy passengers have long wished they were in first class with lie-flat beds and nice meals, but now it seems there is someone else to envy - the cabin crew. A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an\u00a0in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests\u00a0for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to\u00a030 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Pilots have their own separate sleeping quarters, such as this one, on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Looking out over the passengers: Cabin crew can keep an eye on everyone on the flight in case of any issues", "text": "zodiac aerospace unveils new design for cabin crew sleeping quarters . each bunk is equipped with a personal service unit -lrb- psu -rrb- offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system . concept revealed at aircraft interiors expo in hamburg .", "id": "e87984842cccc73e1fcb5da99f27c0a0d6355796", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Zodiac Aerospace unveils new design for cabin crew sleeping quarters.", "Each bunk is equipped with a personal service unit -LRB- PSU-RRB-.", "The personal service unit offers crew with individual comfort features.", "The personal service unit offers an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system.", "The concept was revealed at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9563971161842346}}

The friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We\u2019ve been here one day. We\u2019re no heroes, just tourists,'\u00a0Makrus \u00c5sberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the\u00a0New York Post. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik N\u00e4slund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus \u00c5sberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Alec Stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new Director of England Cricket following the sacking on Wednesday of Managing Director Paul Downton. Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: \u2018When England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no.\u2019 The early bookies\u2019 favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test:\u00a0South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he\u2019d be interested in the post \u2013 created by the ECB\u2019s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton\u2019s demise Wednesday evening \u2013 Stewart said: \u2018I can\u2019t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you\u2019d be stupid not to look at it. \u2018As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it\u2019s the right role, of course I\u2019d listen and have a big conversation \u2013 once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I\u2019m under contract here. \u2018I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I\u2019d look at it. \u2018I\u2019ve got a big job here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on. But at the same time you\u2019ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no. \u2018If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be very close to being at the top of that list.\u2019 Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he\u2019d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. \u2018If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don\u2019t do well, you get moved on. To me, it\u2019s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. \u2018I\u2019m not one for hiding. It\u2019s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.\u2019 Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton \u2013 who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level \u2018We\u2019ve never had a problem with him,\u2019 said Stewart. \u2018I\u2019m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don\u2019t have to handle him. \u2018He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he\u2019d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him. And that\u2019s how I judge people, is how I find them \u2013 not hearsay, or from other people. \u2018England have said he\u2019s not on their radar. But you should never say never. If he\u2019s racking the runs up, and England are struggling, if the players aren\u2019t getting runs or there\u2019s an injury to a batsman, and he\u2019s in top form \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you want to bring him back?\u2019", "text": "alec stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new director of england cricket following the sacking of paul downton . the early bookies ' favourite for the post is michael vaughan . stewart played in a record 133 tests for england and is currently director of cricket at surrey .", "id": "810445408e96d6332086bce30a53f24824db1d04", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Alec Stewart expressed interest in becoming the new director of England cricket.", "The interest was expressed following the sacking of Paul Downton.", "The early bookies' favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan.", "Steward played in a record 133 Tests for England.", "Steward is currently director of cricket at Surrey."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9991285800933838}}

Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that\u00a025 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo \u00a0claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier \u2014 and out of the way \u2014 as other peoples' vehicles piled up. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the sun emerged.

The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company. 'I realised how much I missed that, having someone to care for me and protect me and treat me like a lady.' Julia shows off her pole dancing skills.

Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs.

It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham\u00a0where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period.

Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall.

'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open.

Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld.

Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based\u00a0Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post\u00a0was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I\u2019m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects \u2013 including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video\u00a0Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn\u2019t had [my friend\u2019s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly\u00a0visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,\" he says. \"And I know my son appreciates it.\" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.", "text": "`` i was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me , '' louis jordan says . his father says he held hope because his son had a good boat . `` he 's got very strong constitution and -lrb- is strong -rrb- not only physically , but spiritually , '' he says .", "id": "43b82870a85c31a9dccd43574fb6276516c82325", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Louis Jordan says he was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued him.", "His father says he held hope because his son had a good boat.", "He says he has a very strong constitution.", "He says he is strong -RLB-", "not only physically, but spiritually."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9942884325981141}}

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd.

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Every country in the world may have its rich kids of Instagram, but in Mexico the increasingly ostentatious displays of wealth by the young elite is taking on a political dimension. In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society Laying out and living it up: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes showcase luxurious vacation spots It's just one big fiesta: A glance through the social media profile of a Mirrey often reveals a party picture Bling: Good clothes, nice watches and a flashy style are almost prerequisites for becoming one of the Mirreyes Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money:\u00a0Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages,\u00a0Maclean's\u00a0reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' L\u00f3pez got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the\u00a0daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'. Keeping time: People often post pictures of watches and other luxuries like designer bags and or alcohol Rought: In Mexico, the images of wealth are shocking as households take in an average of $12,850 per year Symbol: Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores (right), who likely died after jumping off a boat, is an example of a Mirrey Purchasing power: Mirreyes might not even think twice about spending hundreds of dollars on a stuffed bear Selfie star: L\u00f3pez, the son of\u00a0then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality,\u00a0Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a \u00a0a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors:\u00a0By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the\u00a0National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.'

The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday\u2019s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday \u2018I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. \u2018It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I\u2019ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,\u2019 Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. \u2018It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. \u2018I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. \u2018I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don\u2019t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.\u2019 Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. \u2018I am loving my job at the moment,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.\u2019 It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC\u2019s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen \u2014 says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He\u2019s only interested if there\u2019s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator \u2013 and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes \u2014 and 26 Test wins overall, a national record.

REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Vaughan is interested in the job in principle, and is close to incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves.

Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog --\u00a0That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram\u00a0account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL\u00a0reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake.

That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range.

This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'", "text": "shutthefrontdoor is favourite for the crabbie 's grand national on april 11 . jonjo o'neill hopes jockey ap mccoy rides the horse to success . mccoy is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys ' championship . click here for more racing news .", "id": "20b231e56a0a2104a96e167659222986fbcaeddd", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["ShuttheFrontdoor is favourite for the Crabbie's Grand National on April 11.", "Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey Ap McCoy rides the horse to success.", "McCoy is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys'championship.", "Click here for more racing news."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.5083983689546585}}

Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn \u00a37 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about \u00a3100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'", "text": "university student reveals how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover the cost of living in london . speaking through the english collective of prostitutes , the woman said that she did n't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her .", "id": "5a0fc5446164c69f250c817608999785dbfd635c", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["University student turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover the cost of living in London.", "The woman said she did not immediately turn to prostitution.", "She used prostitution as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9985807140668234}}

But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night \u2013 before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th, missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second, with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull.

{"dataset": "FRANK", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Barry Beavis, 48, lost his case at the Court of Appeal Millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that \u00a385 was not an 'excessively high' penalty for staying too long in a car park. Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges \u2013 who are thought to earn more than \u00a3200,000 a year \u2013 of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the \u00a385 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the \u00a385 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think \u00a385 isn't extravagant. 'An \u00a385 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer \u2013 it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe \u00a385 is not an extravagant amount then what is? \u00a3100? \u00a3200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider \u00a385 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. \u00a385 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge \u2013 Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd \u2013 are all thought to earn around \u00a3202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay \u2013 sometimes for only a few minutes \u2013 in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.", "text": "barry beavis , 48 , from chelmsford , essex , was fined \u00a3 85 for staying too long . he launched a legal bid to overturn the fine saying it was unfair and unenforceable . but court of appeal judges said the fine was neither ` extravagant or unconscionable ' motoring groups reacted in fury , accusing judges of being ` out of touch '", "id": "bc57e520b34b77aa4c199d10bf64b58767b588ea", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Barry Beavis, 48, from Chelmsford, Essex, was fined \u00a3 85 for staying too long.", "He launched a legal bid to overturn the fine saying it was unfair and unenforceable.", "But Court of Appeal judges said the fine was neither extravagant or unconscionable.", "Motoring groups reacted in fury, accusing judges of being  out of touch'."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.7918584011495113}}

'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said.

The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the Linwoods of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high-quality jobs of the future. 'And, yes, patriotism means a strong Scottish parliament but it doesn't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country, sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country, far better than pooling the resources of only five million people, to secure the best pensions imaginable.' SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon joins  female activists in Glasgow's Buchanan Street to launch the party's womens pledge today Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'While Gordon Brown appears to be re-fighting last year's referendum, the SNP are out talking to voters about next month's General Election and the huge opportunity to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. The contrast could not be clearer. 'Unfortunately for Labour Brown's speech this morning simply reminds people once again of how Labour stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories for two and a half years to talk Scotland down.

Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list.

Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation. Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.'

The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute\u00a0who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.'

FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive.

He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" \u2014 on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May \u2014 lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse\u00a0Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost \u00a312,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The \u00a388,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow.

Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it.

The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new \"subject\" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. \"In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,\" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed \"at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',\" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\". \"We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,\" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. \"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. \"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. \"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. \"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. \"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. \"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. \"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. \"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.", "text": "Conor McGregor is set to be allowed to use 8oz gloves in his boxing debut against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on 26 August, the Nevada commission has confirmed.", "id": "40883148", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Conor McGregor is set to be allowed to use 8oz gloves in his boxing debut against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on 26 August.", "The Nevada Commission has confirmed the decision."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.3185959067195654}}

A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want\u2026 Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. \"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua. Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of \"destabilising the market\". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours. The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said. The news agency said \"seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences. A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report.

Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than \u00c2\u00a3450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "article": "After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: \"Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. \"Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. \"The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. \"But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs.\" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: \"We are all gutted.

It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly.\" Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan. Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so.

From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a \"window period\" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms. The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: \"We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. \"Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. \"The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.\" The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.

'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on.

Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point.

The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter. Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised. Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals. Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke. Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th.

The England number one appeared devastated after the final whistle at Old Trafford and acknowledged that City's bid to retain their Premier League title was over.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Ashley Young is desperate to avoid being part of the first United team to lose five successive Manchester derbies. United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City. Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season. United have lost the last four derbies to City:. 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City. 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United. 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City. 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United. United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'  .", "text": "Manchester City have won the last four Manchester derbies.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.", "text": "An NPR report on the unrest in Baltimore focused on tensions between blacks and Asians.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him \u2013 but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur\u2019s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea\u2019s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas\u2019 late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances \u2013 as many as the rest of Chelsea\u2019s back four put together \u2013 and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger\u2019s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal\u2019s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over \u2013 one more than they\u2019d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January \u2013 a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them \u2013 a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom\u2019s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion\u2019s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football\u2019s black and white days \u2013 every one of Albion\u2019s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow \u2013 and captain Darren Fletcher\u2019s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It\u2019s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total \u2013 Christian Benteke\u2019s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman\u2019s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn\u2019t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue \u2013 Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals\u2019 youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months \u2013 just in time to be available for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke\u2019s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One \u2013 it\u2019s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe\u2019s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who\u2019ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has taken League Two by storm since being loaned out by Bristol City.  .", "text": "Yannick Bolasie scored a hat - trick in Crystal Palace's 4 - 1 win over Sunderland.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Barcelona will offer \u00a350million for in-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, and plan to let him stay in Italy for a year on loan. Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. . SPORT say Barcelona will make a \u00a350m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga. Pogba is said to be the subject of a \u00a350m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals. Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo. SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan. David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend. Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table. It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal. Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal. With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years. He is a leader on the pitch and it's good to know that he will be with us.' Benfica face Nacional on Saturday hoping to keep up their excellent home form which has seen them concede just two goals at the Estadio da Luz all season. The Italian papers have gone big on the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Carlos Tevez (left) could add PSG to his list of clubs if reports in the Italian press are to be believed. Finally, the Italian papers are going big on the race with the Champions League. Both Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport look to Saturday's Roma-Napoli showdown as the first of a few clashes to decide the placings at the top of the table come the end of the season. . Corriere also note that PSG could be a possible destination for Pogba, and that they are looking for a double swoop on Juventus with Carlos Tevez also a target. . There is also a small mention for how Carlo Ancelotti could return to manage AC Milan from Real Madrid if the Spanish club call time on their Italian manager. .  .", "text": "Barcelona will offer \u00a3 50 m for Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, according to Spanish paper SPORT.

Retirement beckons for McCoy, champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997, and he will stop riding immediately if his mount Shutthefrontdoor wins the \u00a31million Crabbie\u2019s Grand National on Saturday. AP McCoy celebrates Grand National victory on Don\u2019t Push It in 2010. Shutthefrontdoor, trained by Jonjo O\u2019Neill, will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once-a-year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don\u2019t Push It. .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "REJECTION PROOF. by Jia Jiang. (Random House, \u00a313.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it\u2019s galling. And in every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn\u2019t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn\u2019t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of \u2018quest\u2019 books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn\u2019t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch\u2019s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying \u2018Free refill\u2019, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. \u2018When are you looking for these?\u2019 she asked. \u2018In the next . . . 15 minutes?\u2019. \u2018Let me see what I can do,\u2019 she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it\u2019s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang\u2019s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else\u2019s opinion, and it may not be the right one.  .", "text": "Jia Jiang spent 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog.

This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago.

SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt \u2014 captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games.

A Sydney harbour pilot finally boarded this morning and the ship, carrying 2,500 holidaymakers and 1,500 crew, docked at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at around 10am. . Scroll down for videos    . The 2500 passengers on board a cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea due to wild weather conditions, have finally arrived at Sydney Harbour this morning. Holidaymakers were due to disembark the Carnival Spirit on Tuesday morning but the Sydney storm prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. The port in Sydney reopened on Wednesday morning, allowing the ship made its way through the harbour to dock. Passengers from the cruise ship Carnival Spirit disembark at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal. 'We're so relieved to just get off,' passenger Courtney Randall said as she disembarked the liner. 'Inside everyone was sick, it was really quite rocky.' 'Everyone is ready to get off,' Debbie from Cherrybrook told ABC radio as the ship headed towards the shore. Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised. 'At one stage, I looked out the window and one of the waves crashed up against the glass. I freaked out and closed the curtains. I couldn't deal with it,' Athanasia Georgoudakis, from Yagoona in Sydney's south-west, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'This is the last [cruise]. If I want to go on holiday I will catch a plane. I will not take another cruise, never.' Vacationers were put on edge as 'a lot of water' coming through glass panels and some of the crew were also frightened by the experience. One passenger has told how many travellers have been 'vomiting for two days' due to rough seas conditions. A spokesperson for the cruise liner said that boarding is expected to commence at 2.30pm for their modified 7-day Isle de Pines vacation, with plans to set sail by 7pm.  A camera on the cruise captures the moment it finally enters Sydney Harbour on Wednesday morning. One member of staff, who had worked on cruise ships for six years said that he had been sea sick and was very relieved to be back on shore. 'I was pretty scared of the roughness because I've experienced nothing like that before,' he told Daily Mail Australia, asking not to be identified. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday. . It had been due to dock on Tuesday morning but Sydney Harbour was closed to traffic as conditions were so bad. The crew had pleaded for calm on board the ship, saying it was built to withstand the storm, which has been described as a 'once in a century' weather event. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship.

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning. The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves. While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.' . At 8.25am on Wednesday, Carnival Cruise Line Australia finally posted a message on their Facebook page that their ship had been cleared to dock. \u2018(We) have been notified that the port in Sydney is now open to ship traffic and we're happy to say the weather has improved to allow safe entry into the port,' it read. The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather. 'The pilot is now on board and ship is proceeding to the terminal and is expected to be alongside no later than 10am. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.\u2019.

Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up. 'It's disappointing that we lost one day of travel as we were supposed to leave yesterday and we would have cancelled our trip all together if it didn't sail today,' Dr Proctor said.

He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral.

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. . Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. . His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. . She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. . Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. . 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges. 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "An architect who arranged to meet a woman on a blind date raped her several hours later while telling her 'girls say no but they don't really mean it,' a court has heard. Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.'  . Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. . Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the \u00a3500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. . Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: \"No\" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: \"No\", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: \"Girl\u2019s say: No, but they don\u2019t mean it.\" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app \u2018Let\u2019s Date\u2019 - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, \"Joe\u2019s\", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together. Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured. 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn\u2019t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: \"Nothing is going to happen.\" I\u2019m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant\u2019s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: \"No, no,\" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn\u2019t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running. The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: \"Welcome to my crack den.\" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: \"No\" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.  .

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .", "text": "Alexander Kristoff beat off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "The Duchess of Cambridge's baby is due as early as today, it has been revealed. According to one well-placed source, Kate's real due date is today or tomorrow - which would tie in with comments made by the Duchess herself. Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry. Kensington Palace have also said that rather than return directly to Australia, where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the Australian Defence Force, Harry will briefly travel back to London instead. Harry will attend Sunday's London Marathon, which, according to Palace sources, is a long-standing commitment but one that could  be confirmed only after  his Australian army schedule had been firmed up. .  .", "text": "Duchess of Cambridge said her baby is due' mid to late April' Last month, she said:' Not long to go now' April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date.

He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. . Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler.

He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' .

'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.'

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling\u2019s interview didn\u2019t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn\u2019t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I\u2019m hoping that that wasn\u2019t the whole point, as we\u2019ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: \u2018let him go\u2019. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money\u2019s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers. Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract. Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It\u2019s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there\u2019s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the \u00a3100,000-a-week contract he\u2019s turned down. But it\u2019s only that: potential. At present, he\u2019s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he\u2019s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn\u2019t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  . And while I\u2019d be willing to see the club give him \u00a3100k a week \u2013 possibly \u00a3120k a week - the club shouldn\u2019t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I\u2019m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling\u2019s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he\u2019s welcome to. Personally, I don\u2019t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United. Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club. If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he\u2019s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we\u2019ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he\u2019s easily worth \u00a325-30 million. If I was FSG, I\u2019d hold any interested club to ransom, though \u2013 double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn\u2019t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there\u2019s little Arsenal can offer that we can\u2019t. Sure, they\u2019re more financially stable but what \u2013 in terms of trophies \u2013 do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract. I think we\u2019re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren\u2019t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he\u2019s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won\u2019t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. . An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'. The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. Elle is well-known for her healthy diet and even released her own superfood product, The Super Elixir. She said: 'Variation is key. I work out 45 minutes a day, six days a week, combining hiking, water skiing, swimming and running on a beach. '(My idea of a healthy diet is) consistency and eating three healthy meals a day. Having said that, red meat, wheat and dairy don't work for me.' Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand. . Last year, Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. She hasn't aged a day! Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle, pictured, left, in 1995 and, right, in 2012,  has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times. The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor \"I don't feel great\". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' Elle has co-created The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, which is made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao and a product that the supermodel credits for helping her get ready for beach holidays . So successful was the launch of the elixir that the duo have added another product to the range: The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein. Made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao, the \u00a345 product is a plant based complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids like those found in red meat, eggs, chicken and fish.

Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right. Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Because she was there. \u2018It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,\u2019 says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. \u2018It was wonderful bedlam. I can\u2019t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.\u2019. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: \u2018I think it\u2019s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. \u2018Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!\u2019. Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes\u2019s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. \u2018With the best will in the world, I can\u2019t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,\u2019 she says. \u2018It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I\u2019m so old now, I\u2019m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.\u2019. The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: \u2018In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going about with an officer who can\u2019t wear her cap properly,\u201d so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: \u2018I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.\u2019. Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. \u2018That didn\u2019t happen,\u2019 laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. \u2018Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.\u2019. Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. \u2018No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,\u2019 insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. \u2018The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,\u2019 says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 \u2013 when Britain celebrated Japan\u2019s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth\u2019s father, King George VI. \u2018He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,\u2019 says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. \u2018It was emancipation,\u2019 says Mrs Rhodes. \u2018I don\u2019t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.\u2019. ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right. By Michael Powell. The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children\u2019s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother\u2019s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room \u2018where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC\u2019. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children\u2019s songs. \u2018One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,\u2019 he said. \u2018The Queen said they were taught them by their mother\u2019s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.\u2019. Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang \u2018very well, beautifully in fact\u2019 during the two-hour recording session. \u2018The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,\u2019 he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. \u2018She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn\u2019t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. \u2018Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else\u2019s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.\u2019. Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother\u2019s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.  .", "text": "Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were let loose to join jubilant crowds.

The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Scott Kelley, now 50, has been arrested a decade after he fled the U.S with stepdaughter Mary Nunes, and her mother Genevieve Kelley. A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. .", "text": "Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, fled U.S. in 2004.

Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.

A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video .

She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner. However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. . In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'. Under her nose: During the three years she was with Castro, he would kidnap 21-year-old Michelle Knight and 17-year-old Amanda Berry. A few months after breaking up, he kidnapped his third victim Gina DeJuses. Roldan pictured above with another man in a picture posted to Facebook. Seemingly normal: Roldan detailed her 'romantic' relationship with Castro in the new book The Lost Girls by John Glatt . Roldan visited Castro at his house often, and sometimes ran into his ex-wife Grimilda Figueroa. Castro abused Figuero during their marriage, but he acted so kind around Roldan that she thought the beatings were just a rumor. As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. . She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. . After the proposal, Castro remained dedicated to Roldan and even bought her a ruby ring. After buying the flashy piece of jewelry, Castro took Roldan along to one of his music gigs where he had yet another romantic gesture in store. .

A year later, he captured 14-year-old Gina DeJesus (center) Mid-way through the performance, he took the microphone and told the audience: 'Today, I gave my girlfriend Lillian a ring.' . 'So everyone clapped,' Lillian recalls. 'And he told the group that he wanted to sing \"La Bamba\" for me. It was so romantic and I was charmed. It was such a special [night] and he really did show me love.' While Castro remained the normal man she called her boyfriend, two years into their relationship he started harboring a secret at home. . In August 2002, Castro kidnapped then 21-year-old Michelle Knight and locked her in his basement. Eight months later, he kidnapped another girl, 17-year-old Amanda Berry.

He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" \u2014 on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May \u2014 lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just \u00a31.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported \u00a3300million profit. Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property \u2013 such as its brand and logo \u2013 in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just \u00a31.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of \u00a3300million \u2013 a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called \u2018immoral\u2019 by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK. Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just \u00a38.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than \u00a33billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary \u00a320million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees \u2013 and was registered at the offices of Starbuck\u2019s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received \u2013 or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks\u2019 Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings \u2013 though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay \u2018normal\u2019 levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get \u2018its mojo back\u2019 before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of \u00a31.1million \u2013 despite sales being a bumper \u00a3300million. On this it paid taxes of just \u00a3232,363, as well as the sum of \u00a311.2million as part of its voluntary \u00a320million tax payment.

'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.'

In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces. Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different. Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' . Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA. One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments. Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests. Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. . Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. . Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. . Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  . Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'   . Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment. One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited. If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write. Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.'  . Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. . How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter. Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests. Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag. Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Half of hospitals in England are allowing patients to jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, new figures reveal (file picture) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, an investigation has revealed. Some are charging up to a \u2018shameful\u2019 \u00a32,700 for one eye \u2013 treble what it costs the health service \u2013 raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of \u00a36,000 each. . Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. . Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between \u00a3800 and \u00a3900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to \u00a32,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: \u2018It\u2019s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . \u2018We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.\u2019. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: \u2018In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. \u2018It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. \u2018Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.\u2019. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients\u2019 Association, added: \u2018The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.\u2019. In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between \u00a3800 and \u00a3900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to \u00a32,700. More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. . Most hospitals charge patients between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to \u00a32,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and \u00a32,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to \u2018self-fund\u2019. The University Hospital Southampton\u2019s website informs patients that \u2018surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait\u2019. It adds: \u2018Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.\u2019. Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will \u2018help you get back to the things you love\u2019.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.", "text": "Robert Durst, 71, is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip\u2026from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.'

Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote. But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.  .", "text": "Nursultan Nazarbayev has won another five year term as president.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .", "text": "Barcelona beat Paris Saint - Germain 3 - 1 to reach the Champions League semi - finals.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel \u2013 pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port \u2013 would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands \u2013 bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month \u2013 and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April\u201311 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago \u2013 Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline \u2013 the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay. You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival \u2013 its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear \u2013 on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war \u2013 plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century. The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey \u2013 around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels \u2013 another military-medical complex \u2013 have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here \u2013 the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag \u2013 laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery \u2013 a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel \u2013 armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource \u2013 over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here \u2013 just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle. The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen \u2013 a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker \u2013 which will also be accessible during the festival \u2013 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters \u2013 the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows \u2013 at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning \u2013 but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond.

Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal.

The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

At the end of last month, the young royal, who lives three and a half thousand miles away from her family in the UK, celebrated her 25th birthday. . In the middle of a Palace function, her father, Prince Andrew, whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan. . The shop stocks trendy brands including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James\u2019s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James\u2019s Palace, saying: \u2018We are going to do something new this evening. \u2018The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it\u2019s her 25th birthday today.\u2019. Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: \u2018You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).\u2019. He then turned to the lance corporal and added: \u2018If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...\u2019 There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. . Eugenie looked delighted and said she was \u2018very proud, Pops\u2019 of her father\u2019s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored \u2018zero points\u2019. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie. Sarah added: \u2018We think you all need to go for choir practice.\u2019 Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. \u2018Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,\u2019 he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: \u2018\u2019What was it somebody said about children and dogs?\u2019. The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account. Eugenie has been in New York for the past year, working for an online auction house. .

Jose Mourinho's side struggled to get into their rhythm and had Thibaut Courtois to thank, following a series of impressive saves to deny Charlie Austin and Matt Phillips. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... . Queens Park Rangers. Rob Green - His dreadful kick led to Chelsea's late winner. Not a moment he'll want to remember in hurry. 5.5. Mauricio Isla - Tasked with taming the interchanging Hazard and Willian and kept at his task admirably. 6.5. Steven Caulker - Alongside Onuoha, the defender dealt with Drogba's threat excellently. 7. Nedum Onuoha - Strong display from the versatile defender, who now looks at home at centre-back. 7. Nedum Onuoha (15) performed well at the back for QPR and kept Didier Drogba quiet throughout. Clint Hill - Showed tremendous desire at left-back and did well to combat both Willian and Hazard. 7. Matt Phillips - Has shone in recent weeks for Rangers and caused Chelsea problems with his pace. 6.5. Joey Barton - Hurried and hassled Chelsea's midfield. Typical energy from the controversial midfielder. 6.5. Joey Barton (centre) put in a good shift for the home side and made life difficult for Chelsea's midfield. Matt Phillips (right) came close to scoring for QPR but his shot was brilliantly saved by Courtois. Sandro - Put a real shift in for Rangers and showed moments of quality, too. Denied a goal by Courtois' brilliance. 6.5. Karl Henry - His defensive instincts were vital as QPR tried to stem Chelsea's attacking flow. 6.5.

Charlie Austin - Caused Chelsea problems with his clever movement and went close on a couple of occasions. 6.5. Subs.

Gary Cahill - Stood up to the physical battle with Austin and Zamora with minimal fuss. 6.5. The Belgian goalkeeper was Chelsea's stand-out performer with a number of crucial saves . John Terry - An unpopular figure at Loftus Road, but stood firm under hostilities from the home crowd. 7.

Ramires - Had little impact in midfield and was hauled off by Mourinho early in the second half. 5. Nemanja Matic - Has had far better afternoons but, as ever, offered a solid-enough shield to his back-four. 6.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.'

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. . Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012. Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott. Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. . Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final. Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year. 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. . Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge. 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.", "text": "Rolling Stone's article about alleged gang rape at University of Virginia drew criticism.

British Captain Leon Smith and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong French team on grass, as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources. Andy Murray in action last year at the Queen's Club, which will host the Davis Cup quarter final against France. Murray celebrates winning at Queen's in 2013 - one of three triumphs he has had at the tournament. Tickets go on sale on May 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000, as it is for the AEGON Championships, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The All England Club\u2019s overworked show courts, plus the redevelopment work being done there, meant that SW19 was never an option only five days after the Championships finish. The fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks\u2019 top level grass court tennis in the UK this summer, a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport\u2019s one organic surface might even disappear. This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen\u2019s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world\u2019s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season. However, they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems.

Murray said: 'Queen\u2019s will be a perfect venue for our quarter-final match against France. I\u2019ve been playing at Queen\u2019s for ten years now so I feel very at home there as do the rest of the British team, so it\u2019s a great choice.

Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. . 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said.

Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad. 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. . In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do.

But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by \u00a33,028 on 'every working family'. . But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. . They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'  Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and \u00a31,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning \u00a31 million a year \u00a3340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of \u00a35 million would get a total tax cut of \u00a31.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut \u00a310 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children \u00a31,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than \u00a33,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over \u00a3150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost \u00a3400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to \u00a312,500. . By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just \u00a337 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the \u00a38 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.'

'Can I ask what triggered this in the first place and why you've done it for so long?' one of the women asked. Kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out her life in the 'wrong way'. .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his \u2018manifestly ill-founded\u2019 case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the \u00a340,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: \u2018This is a shocking example of Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.\u2019. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius\u2019s claim that extradition breached his human rights was \u2018inadmissible\u2019.

The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new \"subject\" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. \"In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,\" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed \"at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',\" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\". \"We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,\" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. \"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. \"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. \"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. \"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. \"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. \"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. \"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. \"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.", "text": "Conor McGregor's plan to wear 8oz gloves in his Las Vegas fight against Floyd Mayweather has been put on hold.", "id": "40883148", "label": "0", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["Conor McGregor's plan to wear 8oz gloves in his Las Vegas fight against Floyd Mayweather has been put on hold."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9678230881690979}}

Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want\u2026 Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. \"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets. The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing. A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua. Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of \"destabilising the market\". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours. The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said. The news agency said \"seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences. A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of \"spreading fake information\" about the market slump, the report said. The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he \"wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications\".

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "article": "They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than \u00c2\u00a3450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber.

After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining.

From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a \"window period\" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: \"This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students. \"We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16.\" The programme, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year. It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms. The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: \"We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. \"Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. \"The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.\" The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data. Ruth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one. \"It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,\" she told the BBC. \"I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage. \"That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.\" Reports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: \"I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities.

The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. .

Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres.

Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. .

The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'.

'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money.

'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.'

The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter. Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised. Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals. Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke. Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans. Les also a hero. Never stop believing.' . QPR stay inside the relegation zone but moved up to 18th place with the draw.

The England number one appeared devastated after the final whistle at Old Trafford and acknowledged that City's bid to retain their Premier League title was over. 'That's one of my worst in a Man City shirt, definitely,' Hart said after a morale-sapping 4-2 defeat saw under-fire Manuel Pellegrini's men go four points adrift of neighbours United and 12 behind runaway leaders Chelsea.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Ashley Young is desperate to avoid being part of the first United team to lose five successive Manchester derbies. United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City. Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season. United have lost the last four derbies to City:. 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City. 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United. 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City. 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United. United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'  .", "text": "Manchester City have won the last four Manchester derbies.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.", "text": "In Baltimore unrest, NPR reported tension between African - Americans and Asian - owned businesses.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him \u2013 but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur\u2019s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea\u2019s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas\u2019 late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances \u2013 as many as the rest of Chelsea\u2019s back four put together \u2013 and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger\u2019s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal\u2019s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over \u2013 one more than they\u2019d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January \u2013 a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them \u2013 a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom\u2019s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion\u2019s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football\u2019s black and white days \u2013 every one of Albion\u2019s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow \u2013 and captain Darren Fletcher\u2019s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It\u2019s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total \u2013 Christian Benteke\u2019s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman\u2019s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn\u2019t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue \u2013 Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals\u2019 youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months \u2013 just in time to be available for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke\u2019s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One \u2013 it\u2019s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe\u2019s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who\u2019ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces.

He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places.

Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. . SPORT say Barcelona will make a \u00a350m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga. Pogba is said to be the subject of a \u00a350m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals. Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo. SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan. David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend. Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table. It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal. Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal. With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years. He is a leader on the pitch and it's good to know that he will be with us.' Benfica face Nacional on Saturday hoping to keep up their excellent home form which has seen them concede just two goals at the Estadio da Luz all season. The Italian papers have gone big on the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Carlos Tevez (left) could add PSG to his list of clubs if reports in the Italian press are to be believed.

Both Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport look to Saturday's Roma-Napoli showdown as the first of a few clashes to decide the placings at the top of the table come the end of the season. . Corriere also note that PSG could be a possible destination for Pogba, and that they are looking for a double swoop on Juventus with Carlos Tevez also a target. .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "REJECTION PROOF. by Jia Jiang. (Random House, \u00a313.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it\u2019s galling. And in every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn\u2019t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn\u2019t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of \u2018quest\u2019 books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn\u2019t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch\u2019s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying \u2018Free refill\u2019, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. \u2018When are you looking for these?\u2019 she asked. \u2018In the next . . . 15 minutes?\u2019. \u2018Let me see what I can do,\u2019 she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it\u2019s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang\u2019s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else\u2019s opinion, and it may not be the right one.  .", "text": "Jia Jiang spent 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected.

This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash .

SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt \u2014 captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings.

Huge waves as high as 40 feet smashed glass panels, shattered plates and cups \u2013 and left many on-board violently seasick as the boat pitched from side to side. A Sydney harbour pilot finally boarded this morning and the ship, carrying 2,500 holidaymakers and 1,500 crew, docked at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at around 10am. . Scroll down for videos    . The 2500 passengers on board a cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea due to wild weather conditions, have finally arrived at Sydney Harbour this morning. Holidaymakers were due to disembark the Carnival Spirit on Tuesday morning but the Sydney storm prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. The port in Sydney reopened on Wednesday morning, allowing the ship made its way through the harbour to dock. Passengers from the cruise ship Carnival Spirit disembark at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal. 'We're so relieved to just get off,' passenger Courtney Randall said as she disembarked the liner. 'Inside everyone was sick, it was really quite rocky.' 'Everyone is ready to get off,' Debbie from Cherrybrook told ABC radio as the ship headed towards the shore. Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised. 'At one stage, I looked out the window and one of the waves crashed up against the glass. I freaked out and closed the curtains. I couldn't deal with it,' Athanasia Georgoudakis, from Yagoona in Sydney's south-west, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'This is the last [cruise]. If I want to go on holiday I will catch a plane. I will not take another cruise, never.' Vacationers were put on edge as 'a lot of water' coming through glass panels and some of the crew were also frightened by the experience. One passenger has told how many travellers have been 'vomiting for two days' due to rough seas conditions. A spokesperson for the cruise liner said that boarding is expected to commence at 2.30pm for their modified 7-day Isle de Pines vacation, with plans to set sail by 7pm.  A camera on the cruise captures the moment it finally enters Sydney Harbour on Wednesday morning. One member of staff, who had worked on cruise ships for six years said that he had been sea sick and was very relieved to be back on shore. 'I was pretty scared of the roughness because I've experienced nothing like that before,' he told Daily Mail Australia, asking not to be identified. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday. . It had been due to dock on Tuesday morning but Sydney Harbour was closed to traffic as conditions were so bad. The crew had pleaded for calm on board the ship, saying it was built to withstand the storm, which has been described as a 'once in a century' weather event.

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning. The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves. While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.' . At 8.25am on Wednesday, Carnival Cruise Line Australia finally posted a message on their Facebook page that their ship had been cleared to dock. \u2018(We) have been notified that the port in Sydney is now open to ship traffic and we're happy to say the weather has improved to allow safe entry into the port,' it read.

Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon. Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used. He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. The information comes after police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. . The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Another man, Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18,  was charged with planning to carry out an  attack. Both men often visited frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. . Prakash is thought of in the same way as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer who was believed killed fighting around the Northern Syrian city of Kobane in late 2014. Mr Haider, whose body is pictured (left) being taken to the coroner for examination, died when he was shot by officers after stabbing two policemen outside a Melbourne police station on September 23. It is believed the two men who masterminded the Anzac Day plot attended his funeral (pictured: right) The father of one of the teens arrested in the raids, said his son had benefited from his time at the controversial Al Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. The teen was interviewed by police all morning before travelling to the Magistrates Court where he was charged.

Earlier, the social media page of  Besim was discovered, which provided insight into the mind of the alleged terrorist. The 18-year-old's Instagram account features posts with anti-Western sentiments and Islamic State propaganda. . Just two days before the teenager was arrested during pre-dawn raids at his Melbourne home, he was perusing the Facebook page of well-known radical Perth-based Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne. Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts'. . Days before he arrested, Besim was browsing the Facebook page of Mohammed Junaid Thorne. Hizb Ut-Ta-Khir is an Islamic fundamentalist group who have a branch in Australia. He was arrested, along with four other teenagers, suspected of planning a terror attack using swords and knives. A number of 'edged weapons'  were seized at some of the properties searched. The father of one of the men arrested, said he believed the controversial Al Furqan Islamic study centre had changed his son's life for the better. Mr Besim did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24. 'Before he started to pray, (he) was in the house aggressive, he broke (things), like a child. But after when he started to pray he really changed behaviour, 100 per cent,' the father told the ABC. . 'Now he was very good, always. Never, never yells, never, never do bad in house. . 'He's always nice talking when I see him, but I (do) not see him very much.' . Controversial posts uncovered on Besim's Instagram page contained strong anti-government sentiments, including one calling U.S. President Barack Obama 'Israel's b**ch'. Another picture expresses his thoughts on the democratic system of politics. He calls U.S. president Barack Obama 'Israel's b**ch' in one of Instagram post on his page. Another picture on Besim's Instagram account expresses his thoughts on the democratic system of politics. One of his posts said 'War on Terror, where the invader is considered a hero and the resistor called a terrorist' 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah,' it said. The hashtag on the post reads: 'Don't Vote 4 Man Made Law.' His Instagram account also revealed Besim had his Facebook account disabled. . The father of the boy also said his family had been traumatised by the dramatic raids. The father said he had a gun held to his head for 30 minutes, and police told him: 'One more word I kill you. Doesn't matter for your kids.' Three other men, also aged 18 and 19, were arrested separately in Narre Warren. Pictured is one of the homes in the suburb where police made one of several arrest during terror raids. Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights. 'My wife she starts screaming. Police call ambulance to come and help her,' the father told the ABC. 'I notice everything in the house is broken, the door, everything.' .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. . Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. . His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. . She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. . Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. . 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges. 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  . When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'", "text": "Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "An architect who arranged to meet a woman on a blind date raped her several hours later while telling her 'girls say no but they don't really mean it,' a court has heard. Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.'  . Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. . Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the \u00a3500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. . Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: \"No\" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: \"No\", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: \"Girl\u2019s say: No, but they don\u2019t mean it.\" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app \u2018Let\u2019s Date\u2019 - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, \"Joe\u2019s\", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together. Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured. 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn\u2019t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: \"Nothing is going to happen.\" I\u2019m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant\u2019s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: \"No, no,\" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn\u2019t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running. The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: \"Welcome to my crack den.\" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: \"No\" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.  .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Team Sky's Geraint Thomas had to settle for 14th place in an incident-packed Tour of Flanders as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff took victory in a sprint finish with Holland's Niki Terpstra. With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .", "text": "Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished 14th in the Tour of Flanders.

According to one well-placed source, Kate's real due date is today or tomorrow - which would tie in with comments made by the Duchess herself. Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry. Kensington Palace have also said that rather than return directly to Australia, where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the Australian Defence Force, Harry will briefly travel back to London instead. Harry will attend Sunday's London Marathon, which, according to Palace sources, is a long-standing commitment but one that could  be confirmed only after  his Australian army schedule had been firmed up. .  .", "text": "The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due' mid to late April'", "id": "a6b9c0736bdd6518aeba502fa8b41bb4bf77fa13", "label": "1", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due' mid to late April."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9989402890205383}}

As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks.

He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. . Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler.

Much thinner: The 34-year-old lost 30 pounds for 2014 thriller Nightcrawler and had  to put that weight  back on plus 15lbs of muscle . He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' . Speaking about his weight loss for Nightcrawler, Jake told Us Weekly: 'I knew that [Lou] was literally and figuratively hungry, [so I got into the] mode where I was always a bit hungry.

Gyllenhaal also attended several boxing matches to watch how real fighters move in the ring. 'It's not different than getting into character for anything. It's more about believing where you are and being present where you are. Who's to say what the process is? I have a strange one \u2026 but I love what I do.' . Claybon explained to Yahoo that Jake put back on the weight he had lost before gaining an extra 15 pounds of muscle for Southpaw. .

'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.'

At his heaviest, he weighed 34st and was forced to order specialist XXXXXL clothes on the internet - the result of topping up his takeaway-heavy diet with six bags of crisps and two bottles of full-fat Coca-Cola a day.

Embarrassed by his size and afraid of cruel comments or being forced to squeeze past people, Mr Rush says he never left the house - and never had a girlfriend.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling\u2019s interview didn\u2019t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn\u2019t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I\u2019m hoping that that wasn\u2019t the whole point, as we\u2019ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: \u2018let him go\u2019. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money\u2019s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers. Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract. Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It\u2019s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there\u2019s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the \u00a3100,000-a-week contract he\u2019s turned down. But it\u2019s only that: potential. At present, he\u2019s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he\u2019s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn\u2019t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  . And while I\u2019d be willing to see the club give him \u00a3100k a week \u2013 possibly \u00a3120k a week - the club shouldn\u2019t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I\u2019m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling\u2019s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he\u2019s welcome to. Personally, I don\u2019t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United. Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club. If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he\u2019s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we\u2019ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he\u2019s easily worth \u00a325-30 million. If I was FSG, I\u2019d hold any interested club to ransom, though \u2013 double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn\u2019t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there\u2019s little Arsenal can offer that we can\u2019t. Sure, they\u2019re more financially stable but what \u2013 in terms of trophies \u2013 do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract. I think we\u2019re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren\u2019t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he\u2019s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won\u2019t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. . An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'.

The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor \"I don't feel great\". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.'

Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right. Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Because she was there. \u2018It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,\u2019 says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. \u2018It was wonderful bedlam. I can\u2019t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.\u2019. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: \u2018I think it\u2019s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. \u2018Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!\u2019. Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes\u2019s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. \u2018With the best will in the world, I can\u2019t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,\u2019 she says. \u2018It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I\u2019m so old now, I\u2019m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.\u2019. The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: \u2018In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going about with an officer who can\u2019t wear her cap properly,\u201d so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: \u2018I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.\u2019. Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. \u2018That didn\u2019t happen,\u2019 laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. \u2018Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.\u2019. Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. \u2018No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,\u2019 insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. \u2018The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,\u2019 says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 \u2013 when Britain celebrated Japan\u2019s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth\u2019s father, King George VI. \u2018He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,\u2019 says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. \u2018It was emancipation,\u2019 says Mrs Rhodes. \u2018I don\u2019t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.\u2019. ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right. By Michael Powell. The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children\u2019s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother\u2019s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room \u2018where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC\u2019. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children\u2019s songs. \u2018One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,\u2019 he said. \u2018The Queen said they were taught them by their mother\u2019s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.\u2019. Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang \u2018very well, beautifully in fact\u2019 during the two-hour recording session. \u2018The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,\u2019 he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. \u2018She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn\u2019t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. \u2018Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else\u2019s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.\u2019. Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother\u2019s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.  .", "text": "A Royal Night Out is released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945.

The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that.

A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. .", "text": "Scott Kelley, now 50, fled the U.S. with stepdaughter Mary Nunes in 2004.

Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.

Bayern are chasing a treble of titles and their fourth straight Champions League semi-final appearance. Twice winners Porto have not reached the last four since winning the trophy in 2004. Lopetegui had the luxury of resting nine players who had played against Bayern in their 1-0 league win over Academica on Saturday. 'We need to put everything we have planned into practice,' said the coach, who was a former Barcelona and Spain team mate of Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Bruno Martins Indi (left) and Vincent Aboubakar (right) lead the way as the Porto squad warm up in Munich. Juan Quintero stretches for the ball at the Allianz Arena as Jackson Martinez (left) and Quaresma watch on. Porto will be without suspended Danilo and Alex Sandro but Jackson Martinez, who made his comeback from injury against Bayern and scored their third goal and Ricardo Quaresma, who scored the other two, are looking in fine form. They also have defender Ivan Marcano back from suspension. 'It will be a very difficult task but we will try to find simple answers,' Lopetegui said. 'We like the idea of playing Bayern, who are one of the best teams in the world. We cannot think about what could happen, we must focus on the game tomorrow and try to give the answer on the pitch,' he said.", "text": "Porto take on Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday.

A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video . Blinded by love: Lillian Roldan (left) says she dated Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro (right) from 2000 to 2003. She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner. However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. . In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'. Under her nose: During the three years she was with Castro, he would kidnap 21-year-old Michelle Knight and 17-year-old Amanda Berry. A few months after breaking up, he kidnapped his third victim Gina DeJuses. Roldan pictured above with another man in a picture posted to Facebook. Seemingly normal: Roldan detailed her 'romantic' relationship with Castro in the new book The Lost Girls by John Glatt . Roldan visited Castro at his house often, and sometimes ran into his ex-wife Grimilda Figueroa. Castro abused Figuero during their marriage, but he acted so kind around Roldan that she thought the beatings were just a rumor. As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. . She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. . After the proposal, Castro remained dedicated to Roldan and even bought her a ruby ring. After buying the flashy piece of jewelry, Castro took Roldan along to one of his music gigs where he had yet another romantic gesture in store. . Free women: Amanda Berry (left), Gina DeJesus (center) and Michelle Knight (right), were held captive in Castro's home for years. They found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old child helped the trio escape . Stolen youth: Castro kidnapped Michelle Knight (right) in 2002 when she was 21, eight months later he kidnapped then 17-year-old Amanda Berry (left). A year later, he captured 14-year-old Gina DeJesus (center) Mid-way through the performance, he took the microphone and told the audience: 'Today, I gave my girlfriend Lillian a ring.' . 'So everyone clapped,' Lillian recalls. 'And he told the group that he wanted to sing \"La Bamba\" for me. It was so romantic and I was charmed. It was such a special [night] and he really did show me love.' While Castro remained the normal man she called her boyfriend, two years into their relationship he started harboring a secret at home. . In August 2002, Castro kidnapped then 21-year-old Michelle Knight and locked her in his basement. Eight months later, he kidnapped another girl, 17-year-old Amanda Berry. Apparently distracted by the two young women that he was torturing at home, Castro abruptly cut ties with Roldan in October of that year, sending her a letter that said he 'didn't love her enough to stay.' . Prison: Above, Catro's Cleveland home where he kept the three women locked up for years . Five months after Roldan received the unexpected break-up letter, Castro's third victim, Gina DeJesus, went missing. She was 14 years old at the time. . For the next nine years the women were locked inside Castro's home and kept secret from the outside world. . The three women found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old daughter by Castro helped the trio to escape the house and alert police. Castro was arrested and sentenced to life in prison plus $1,000 years.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" \u2014 on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May \u2014 lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just \u00a31.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported \u00a3300million profit. Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property \u2013 such as its brand and logo \u2013 in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just \u00a31.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of \u00a3300million \u2013 a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called \u2018immoral\u2019 by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK. Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just \u00a38.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than \u00a33billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary \u00a320million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees \u2013 and was registered at the offices of Starbuck\u2019s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received \u2013 or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks\u2019 Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings \u2013 though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay \u2018normal\u2019 levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get \u2018its mojo back\u2019 before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of \u00a31.1million \u2013 despite sales being a bumper \u00a3300million. On this it paid taxes of just \u00a3232,363, as well as the sum of \u00a311.2million as part of its voluntary \u00a320million tax payment. A Starbucks spokesman said: \u2018We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the European Commission\u2019s state aid investigation in the Netherlands.\u2019 .  .", "text": "Starbucks embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs.

The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a \u00a310million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season.

Divock Origi said the progress of Liverpool's youngsters have heightened his excitement at joining the club . Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club. Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club. 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website.

In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces. Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different. Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' . Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA. One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments. Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests. Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. . Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. . Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. . Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  . Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'   . Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment. One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited. If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write. Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.'  . Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. . How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter. Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests. Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag. Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Half of hospitals in England are allowing patients to jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, new figures reveal (file picture) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, an investigation has revealed. Some are charging up to a \u2018shameful\u2019 \u00a32,700 for one eye \u2013 treble what it costs the health service \u2013 raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of \u00a36,000 each. . Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. . Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between \u00a3800 and \u00a3900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to \u00a32,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: \u2018It\u2019s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . \u2018We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.\u2019. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: \u2018In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. \u2018It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. \u2018Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.\u2019. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients\u2019 Association, added: \u2018The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.\u2019. In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between \u00a3800 and \u00a3900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to \u00a32,700. More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. . Most hospitals charge patients between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to \u00a32,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and \u00a32,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.", "text": "Robert Durst is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip\u2026from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  .", "text": "Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola wore tight - fitting trousers against Porto.

Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote. But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .", "text": "Barcelona reached landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel \u2013 pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port \u2013 would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands \u2013 bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month \u2013 and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April\u201311 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago \u2013 Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline \u2013 the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay. You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival \u2013 its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear \u2013 on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war \u2013 plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century. The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey \u2013 around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels \u2013 another military-medical complex \u2013 have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here \u2013 the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag \u2013 laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery \u2013 a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel \u2013 armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource \u2013 over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here \u2013 just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle. The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen \u2013 a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker \u2013 which will also be accessible during the festival \u2013 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters \u2013 the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows \u2013 at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning \u2013 but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday. Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox. Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle. The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal.

Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

Jose Mourinho's side struggled to get into their rhythm and had Thibaut Courtois to thank, following a series of impressive saves to deny Charlie Austin and Matt Phillips. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... . Queens Park Rangers. Rob Green - His dreadful kick led to Chelsea's late winner. Not a moment he'll want to remember in hurry. 5.5. Mauricio Isla - Tasked with taming the interchanging Hazard and Willian and kept at his task admirably. 6.5. Steven Caulker - Alongside Onuoha, the defender dealt with Drogba's threat excellently. 7. Nedum Onuoha - Strong display from the versatile defender, who now looks at home at centre-back. 7. Nedum Onuoha (15) performed well at the back for QPR and kept Didier Drogba quiet throughout. Clint Hill - Showed tremendous desire at left-back and did well to combat both Willian and Hazard. 7. Matt Phillips - Has shone in recent weeks for Rangers and caused Chelsea problems with his pace. 6.5. Joey Barton - Hurried and hassled Chelsea's midfield. Typical energy from the controversial midfielder. 6.5. Joey Barton (centre) put in a good shift for the home side and made life difficult for Chelsea's midfield. Matt Phillips (right) came close to scoring for QPR but his shot was brilliantly saved by Courtois. Sandro - Put a real shift in for Rangers and showed moments of quality, too. Denied a goal by Courtois' brilliance. 6.5. Karl Henry - His defensive instincts were vital as QPR tried to stem Chelsea's attacking flow. 6.5. Bobby Zamora - No wondergoal this week, but his experience was just as important in this west London derby. 6.5. Charlie Austin - Caused Chelsea problems with his clever movement and went close on a couple of occasions. 6.5. Subs. Niko Kranjcar 6 (for Sandro 81) Junior Hoilett 5.5 (for Zamora 83); Richard Dunne (for Isla 90) Chris Ramsey - 6.5. Charlie Austin (left) nearly scored a spectacular effort in the first half but the Chelsea keeper denied him. Chelsea. Thibaut Courtois - The busier of the two keepers; produced a brilliant save in the second to deny Phillips. 7.5. Branislav Ivanovic - Looked comfortable for much of the afternoon as opponent Henry showed little attacking intent. 6.5. Gary Cahill - Stood up to the physical battle with Austin and Zamora with minimal fuss. 6.5. The Belgian goalkeeper was Chelsea's stand-out performer with a number of crucial saves . John Terry - An unpopular figure at Loftus Road, but stood firm under hostilities from the home crowd. 7. Cesar Azpilicueta - The left-back was kept busy by Phillips down QPR's right, but emerged with plenty credit. 7. Ramires - Had little impact in midfield and was hauled off by Mourinho early in the second half. 5. Nemanja Matic - Has had far better afternoons but, as ever, offered a solid-enough shield to his back-four. 6. Cesar Azpilicueta (left) kept QPR's dangerous attackers quiet and was good going forward to join the attack. Cesc Fabregas - The masked midfielder was off-key all afternoon before popping up with the winner. 6.5. Willian - Tireless as ever down both Chelsea flanks, but couldn't help his side break down resolute Rangers. 6.5. Eden Hazard - A quieter than usual afternoon for the Belgian, but still provided a telling contribution for the winner. 6.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.  .", "text": "Justus Howell was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois.", "id": "6ecc56a4efa262e37beaad4f46a77a36e22f5c19", "label": "1", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["Justus Howell was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9979971051216125}}

The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show. Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex. Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. . The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. . Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. . Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012. Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott. Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. . Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final. Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year. 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. . Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge. 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.", "text": "Danny Cevallos: UVA, Phi Kappa Psi, other fraternities can't sue for defamation.

British Captain Leon Smith and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong French team on grass, as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources.

This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen\u2019s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world\u2019s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season.

Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. . 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said.

The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad. 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. . In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.", "text": "Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, a fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups.", "id": "b8803c87ad83ffc194b4161bfcdd6e9584e7d653", "label": "1", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["Tuesday is Equal Pay Day.", "Equal Pay Day is a fictitious holiday.", "Equal Pay Day is marked by progressive women's groups."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9993722041447958}}

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone.

Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut \u00a310 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children \u00a31,440 over four years.

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than \u00a33,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over \u00a3150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost \u00a3400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to \u00a312,500. . By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just \u00a337 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the \u00a38 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'", "text": "Labour ramp up attack on the Tories on the eighth day of campaigning.

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "cnndm", "article": "A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his \u2018manifestly ill-founded\u2019 case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the \u00a340,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: \u2018This is a shocking example of Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.\u2019. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius\u2019s claim that extradition breached his human rights was \u2018inadmissible\u2019. They added: \u2018The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.\u2019 .", "text": "Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him. 52 - year - old is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, including two murders. spun out legal battle by insisting he was mentally ill.", "id": "3ef37c492fd0b1547f3e34dd04b82e6607c490d5", "label": "0", "model_name": "Pegasus", "text_claims": ["Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him.", "52-year-old is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania.", "Two murders were committed in Lithuania.", "Kestutis Martuzevicius spun out legal battle.", "Kestutis Martuzevicius insisted he was mentally ill."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.999250853061676}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism. Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult. The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction. The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures. Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: \"At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way. \"That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury. \"Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.\" Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council. The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further. He added: \"CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also. \"The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day.\" Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents. The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis. Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: \"I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here. \"People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe. \"The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.\" Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there. A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total. Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise \u00c2\u00a360,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \"Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks \"threatened internet safety\". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. \"The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety,\" the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. \"My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog.\" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. \"There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way,\" he explained. \"We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\" It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. \"I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level,\" he said. \"A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. \"I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there.\" Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. \"They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" he said. \"It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. \"That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. \"I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.", "text": "When the Channel 4 show Skins came to an end 10 years ago, it was one of the most popular shows of its kind in the UK, with millions of people tuning in to watch the cast battle it out on the small screen.", "id": "31873298", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The Channel 4 show Skins came to an end 10 years ago.", "It was one of the most popular shows of its kind in the UK.", "Millions of people tuned in to watch the cast battle it out on the small screen."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.24346745014190674}}

The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed \"the system has failed him\", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a \"nuisance rather than a victim\" by police, adding that the experience had left her \"a changed person\".

I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Healthwatch England put in a Freedom of Information request and found psychiatric patients now spend six fewer days in hospital than in 2012-13. The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of \"bed days\" per patient per year has fallen by 10%. Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home. \"What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.\" Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk. \"The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" he said. Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013. He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team. His wife, Linda, said: \"They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.\" Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death. The coroner said he \"required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available\". South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: \"The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.\" According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, investment across the three priority areas - crisis resolution, early intervention and assertive outreach - fell for the first time, by \u00a329.3m from \u00a3520m. Her annual report notes this is \"significant\" given \"the co-existing reduction in bed availability\". Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem. \"Mental health accounts for about 23% of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11% of the funding. \"If the government is serious about putting mental health care on an equal footing with physical health, then it's going to need a really serious commitment in the next parliament.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Commissioners are expected to give a real-terms funding increase to mental health this year. \"NHS funding for mental health increased by \u00a3300m last year.\"", "text": "The number of patients being cared for at home by mental health trusts in England has fallen by 10% in the past year, according to new figures.", "id": "32782647", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The number of patients being cared for at home by mental health trusts in England has fallen by 10% in the past year.", "New figures show that the number of patients being cared for at home by mental health trusts in England has fallen by 10% in the past year."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.5698660165071487}}
{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "These are external links and will open in a new window. \"No-one will face a cliff edge,\" Theresa May said at a Brussels summit. A new \"UK settled status\" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. An estimated 3.2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK \"does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up\". Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining \"UK settled status\" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, \"I hate Brexit from every angle.\" \"It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,\" he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach. \"I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,\" Mr Rutte said. \"I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.\" Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. \"This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,\" he said.

During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks. These show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks. \"And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report their account in this week's edition of Science Magazine. Their study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so-called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth. The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km-wide bowl known as the \"peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. These would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And that is precisely what the team found. \"Once we got through the impact melt on top, we recovered pink granite. It was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But these were not normal granites, of course. They were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock's individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. This describes the roughly 15km-wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth's surface some 30km deep and 80-100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole. \"If this deep-rebound model is correct (it's called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So their total travel path is something like 30km, and they do that in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink's liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks it hit also behaved like a fluid. \"These rocks must have lost their strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had their friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan. \"So, yes, temporarily, they behave like a fluid. It's the only way you can make a crater like this.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that it provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth's Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as they attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP).

In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\". But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.  \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as  The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70\u2009million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January.

Ashworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments. The plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards. And he believes improvements can be seen already. \"I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages,\" Ashworth said. \"We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further. But there are some success stories. \"In order to win things at senior level, we need to develop players who can deal with the ball in all areas of the pitch. We have to prioritise that in the development teams. \"They're young players and they'll make mistakes - it will cost us games. We have to accept that.

What a wasted opportunity to gather invaluable international experience,\" the former England captain added on his Twitter page. Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the \"culture is rotten\" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. \"There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We have a talent pool to match any nation.

The court heard the abuse began when she was aged six and continued for about 10 years. She said she had wanted to commit suicide and hoped, when she confronted Beales last summer, it would bring some kind of closure. But she said it had not and she was still on strong medication for depression and anxiety, and was awaiting counselling. The court had heard she confronted Beales at his home and he admitted in front of her mother and his wife he had groped her as a child. He later said \"that was what men did\". The woman said every time she came into contact with Beales he made hurtful comments. She said: \"Once again I felt suicidal and felt I could not continue suffering while he was living a happy and carefree life, with no apparent suffering.\" The woman said one of her biggest wishes in life was to start a family. But she added: \"I worry that there may be internal physical damage due to the abuse which may mean I am unable to conceive or carry a child to full term.\" She said she felt she could not trust anyone and saw the world \"as a very dangerous place\". \"I am hyper vigilant when kids are left unattended or unsupervised around men,\" she told the court. \"I feel unable to relax, and as though I have a responsibility to be watchful over others.\" Defending barrister Andrew Green said Beales had no previous convictions and accepted some acts had taken place but he denied other allegations including all the rapes. Jailing him, Judge Rowlands said Beales did not have \"an ounce of remorse\" and was \"devoid of any moral compass at all\". He will have to serve a further 12 months on licence. Det Insp William Jones, of North Wales Police, said: \"John (Jack) Beales was a manipulative and depraved sexual predator who committed multiple offences over a sustained period of time. He is now thankfully behind bars. \"No child should ever have to experience what the victim went through.\" An NSPCC Wales spokesman said the victim \"must be commended for showing incredible bravery in reporting what happened to her so Beales could eventually face justice for his crimes\".", "text": "A \" manipulative and depraved sexual predator\" who raped and sexually abused a Denbighshire woman over a 10-year period has been jailed for 12 years.", "id": "38320357", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A manipulative and depraved sexual predator raped and sexually abused a Denbighshire woman over a 10-year period.", "The sexual predator has been jailed for 12 years."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.39682793617248535}}

Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a \"covert tape\" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said \"my client denies giving a confession\". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "They will consider plans by Third Energy to frack a well at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in the district of Ryedale. Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC.", "text": "A decision on whether to allow fracking for shale gas in North Yorkshire is due to be made at a meeting of the county council's planning committee.", "id": "36276459", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A decision on whether to allow fracking for shale gas in North Yorkshire is due to be made at a meeting of the county council's planning committee."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.17879271507263184}}
{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "These are external links and will open in a new window. BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. \"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world. \"We are extremely ambitious for this new service. \"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. \"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a \u00c2\u00a3650m cut.  Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the \u00c2\u00a3600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made. He said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future. \"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four.\" Later in the same document, though, the BBC states \"it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make.\" The BBC's plans for \"a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal \"a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies\". \"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster,\" said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented \"BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. \"There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\" \"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan \"a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment\".

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market. \"One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,\" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study. The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places. \"The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch. In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are \"less accepting\" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been \"encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities.  But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria\". There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium \"designated schools\". But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools. \"Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework. \"There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools. \"I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues. \"Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a \"learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (\u00c2\u00a368,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness. \"It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" she says. \"Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison's Ms Yip. Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate. \"I identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills. \"If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.\" \"The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.", "text": "Ethnic minority children in Hong Kong are still being denied equal access to education, according to a new report by the Equal Opportunities Commission.", "id": "34444284", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Ethnic minority children in Hong Kong are still being denied equal access to education.", "A new report by the Equal Opportunities Commission states that ethnic minority children in Hong Kong are still being denied equal access to education."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9731638431549072}}

Mr Jones said: \"This is yet another fantastic high profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector. \"TVR is another iconic and much loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label Made in Wales.\" There have been 350 advance orders for the car already, after images of what it might look like were released late last year. TVR chairman Les Edgar  said: \"This is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh Government. \"South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here.\" The company hopes to be producing around 2,000 cars a year by 2022, targeting the UK and selected European markets initially. It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton. Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent. The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth \u00c2\u00a33.2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative. It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines. That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant. It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement \"sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing\". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was \"surging from strength to strength.\" He added: \"Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy.\" Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year. Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as \"fantastic\" for the region. \"Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries,\" he added.", "text": "First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he is \"delighted\" TVR is to build its next generation of cars in Ebbw Vale, south Wales, in a deal worth \u00c2\u00a3100m.", "id": "35775158", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["First Minister Carwyn Jones said he is 'delighted'.", "TVR is to build its next generation of cars in Ebbw Vale, south Wales.", "The deal is worth \u00a3100m."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.3585688869158427}}

Asked if Saturday's opponents have scrummaged illegally during the tournament, England head coach Eddie Jones said: \"100%.

Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. \"He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger,\" said McBryde. Wales, who are one point behind Six Nations leaders England with two games remaining, felt harshly done by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup. And McBryde said loose-head Marler had been \"found out\" when England lost to Australia in their next World Cup game. \"There was a big focus on the loose-heads' angles, particularly with [Wales prop] Gethin Jenkins being highlighted,\" said McBryde. \"So we were very disappointed in that England game to fall on the wrong side of decisions and we felt the problem lay elsewhere.\" However, Jones says he is \"quite upset\" by Wales' approach to the set-piece. \"They play the laws very well,\" the Australian told BBC Radio 5 live. \"They pre-engage all the time, which is against the laws of the game. \"And then they get penalised one or two times at the start of the game, but the referee gets sick of penalising it. \"Because if the referee keeps penalising it, you know what happens?

The money will be distributed to \"community-led\" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing. Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991. The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices. It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years. In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that \u00a360m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on \"community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities\". The Department for Communities and Local Government said the \u00a360m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem. It announced that the South West is set to get \u00a319,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly. The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, \u00a311,336,157.

In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills.. Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: \"We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall.\" Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: \"The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community. \"This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone.\" During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas.

He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said.

An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.", "text": "Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has often been accused of being a bit of a one-trick pony when it comes to leading his team to success.", "id": "26966304", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has often been accused of being a bit of a one-trick pony.", "Diego Simeone is accused of leading his team to success."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.4981977513525635}}

We are now focusing elsewhere.\" Team principal Christian Horner said he was doing \"necessary due diligence\" in talking to other manufacturers. With their partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because they do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device. The German giant is also concerned about what it and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull's history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull's relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team's frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over. Honda is the only other manufacturer in F1, but partner McLaren would almost certainly exercise their veto over any potential deal with Red Bull, who in any case are not believed to be interested in a deal with the Japanese company at this stage.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Derek Bruder was giving evidence as the inquests focused on the final movements of 15-year-old Kevin Williams. He said he made his first statement shortly after the 1989 disaster and was visited by police the following year. While the meeting left him \"confused\", he agreed to make changes. The officer concerned, former Insp Matthew Sawers, denied asking Mr Bruder to change the sense of his statement. Mr Bruder told the inquests into the 96 deaths at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 that he was visited by an inspector from West Midlands Police, who were supplying evidence to the first inquests. He said Insp Sawers spent six hours with him. When the officer went to the bathroom, Mr Bruder said he looked through some of his notes. He said he found a sheet of paper divided lengthways in two, with handwritten notes on it. On one side it said \"first statement\" and on the other side it said \"change to\", Mr Bruder said. During the meeting he said he was asked to speak over the phone to a pathologist from the coroner's office. Mr Bruder, who was 22 at the time of the disaster, said he conceded \"to the doctor's medical superiority\" when it was suggested Kevin could not have been alive when Mr Bruder tried to revive him. He agreed to make changes to his original statement. Among them he accepted he may have been mistaken to say he had felt \"a faint pulse\" while trying to save Kevin. Mr Bruder told the jury he was 100% confident he had felt a pulse and had seen the teenager move while lying on the pitch. The court heard he wrote to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2012 to say West Midlands Police had made a \"deliberate attempt\" to make him change his statement. He told the inquests he stood by that view and the inspector who visited him had not been honest with him. Earlier Mr Bruder told the inquests that, along with a St John Ambulance volunteer medic who gave heart massage, he had tried to resuscitate Kevin. He said he was \"absolutely 100% confident\" he felt a pulse in the teenager's neck, adding: \"It was not something that would appear to me to be absolutely healthy, beating vibrantly, but there was definitely a pulse.\" Asked whether he saw any signs of life while giving CPR, Mr Bruder said: \"Well, to me he was alive. There was a faint pulse.\" The jury also heard from two Liverpool fans who tried to help Kevin while Mr Bruder was with him. One of them, Stephen Rankin, said Kevin did not show any signs of life. Mr Bruder said a female St John Ambulance medic eventually joined the group, and took over the CPR. After trying to resuscitate him she said Kevin had died. Mr Sawers, who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police, told the inquests he had been asked by the original coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to visit Mr Bruder to get further explanation and detail around evidence, including the convulsions and pulse. He was to give a summary of the further statement to the inquests the following day, but denied he had applied pressure on Mr Bruder or had attended with the intention of changing his statement. Mr Sawers said: \"I did not cause him to change the sense of the statement. What I did was to go through the details and to elicit more detail and explanation. \"Everything that I did in my encounter with PC Bruder was done with integrity and with the best of intentions. It wasn't something that I had any personal stake in.\" But Pete Weatherby, representing Kevin's family, suggested there had been \"a determined effort\" to change his statement which was \"inconvenient to the investigation\". Mr Weatherby said that \"it was very inconvenient that here was a serving police officer giving evidence of vital signs in a casualty that died\". He suggested that as a result of the meeting, Mr Sawers came away with a second statement that \"loosened up\" evidence about Kevin's vital signs.

He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force. \"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],\" he said. \"Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.\" Accusing the Americans of \"interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine\", he said: \"There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.\" Mr Glazyev predicted the situation there would \"normalise\" if the US desisted from intervening. Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states. The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment. It descended into violence last month after a new law to curb protests - which has since been repealed - provoked fury among the opposition. At least three protesters died in the violence, as did at least three police officers, and hundreds of people were injured. The opposition accuses the security forces of abducting and torturing activists. One of these, Dmytro Bulatov, who has been receiving medical treatment in Lithuania, told reporters on Thursday he had been beaten, choked and interrogated in an ordeal lasting eight days. \"I was telling them lies just to stop the torture,\" said Mr Bulatov, 35. \"At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it anymore.\"", "text": "Russia's top adviser to President Vladimir Putin has accused the US of \"interfering flagrantly and unilaterally\" in Ukraine, saying the US and Russia are obliged to guarantee the sovereignty of the country.", "id": "26068994", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Russia's top adviser to President Vladimir Putin accused the US of interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in Ukraine.", "The US and Russia are obliged to guarantee the sovereignty of the country."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9964535236358643}}

The 12ft-high (3.6m) statue features about 40,000 spoons and has taken almost five months to build at the British Ironworks Centre in Oswestry. The spoons have been donated from across the world, as well as local schoolchildren. It is due to be transported to Mr Geller's home in Berkshire on 28 May. It was hoped the statue could be transported to Berkshire by helicopter, but after safety fears, the Ironworks Centre said the TV production company behind Shipping Wars had stepped forward to help. By Bethan BellBBC News. About 250 people toasted the unveiling of the gorilla statue in a sunny Oswestry. The British Ironworks Centre had long kept the project under wraps so there was a palpable sense of intrigue and anticipation about what a 12ft high gorilla made entirely of spoons would actually look like. Uri Geller was clearly very pleased with the end result. He even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said it had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. He said he was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, himself donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as \"an amazing piece of art\". He said: \"This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children.\" \"I am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend,\" he added. \"It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand-welded every spoon to the statue, said he had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media. \"Initially we thought we only needed 5,000 spoons, but it's incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40,000,\" he said. \"It's been incredibly repetitive, but it's been a challenge. The spoons have been different sizes, different metals.\" He said the project had given him \"sleepless nights\" and now \"just the word 'spoon' is enough to drive me crazy\". Mr Bradley added that the gorilla's pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, he said he had come to think of the statue as \"a protector\" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said he believed the past five months had cost the firm about \u00c2\u00a3120,000 in staff time, but described it as an \"exciting rollercoaster of a ride\". He said the experience had given the firm \"an immense appetite to do something even better\" and appealed to the public to suggest a new project that would \"celebrate Britain\".", "text": "A giant gorilla made entirely of spoons has been unveiled by comedian Uri Geller at an Ironworks Centre in Shropshire.", "id": "27453471", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A giant gorilla made entirely of spoons has been unveiled by comedian Uri Geller.", "The gorilla was unveiled at an Ironworks Centre in Shropshire."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.49512717622565106}}

Her mother Caterina De Filippo, 58, and sister Palma De Filippo, 28, were given 12-month sentences for helping her. Domenico Masciopinto was sentenced to 22 months, after admitting concealing criminal property, to run consecutively to his 14-year term.

Judge Kristina Montgomery QC, sitting at Amersham Law Courts for Aylesbury Crown Court, said the Masciopintos would have been jailed for longer if they had not admitted the crime. Cash was found by police stuffed around the Bedford homes of Giulia Masciopinto, in Redhall Close, and her mother's in Harrowden Road, in March 2013.

But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half. Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win. Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals. Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick. As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives. Media playback is not supported on this device. Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan. The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays.

Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought. \"The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that. \"From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards...

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. \"It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,\" Nish says. \"The code-overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.", "text": "A hacking group based in North Korea is believed to have been behind the global ransomware attack that hit the NHS in May, the BBC has learned.", "id": "40297493", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A hacking group based in North Korea is believed to have been behind the global ransomware attack.", "The global ransomware attack hit the NHS in May.", "The BBC has learned about the hacking group."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.998558779557546}}
{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent \"excessive\" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. \"Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,\" she said. \"Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.\" Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that:. The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. \"It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,\" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. \"I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,\" he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the \u00c2\u00a35,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. \"I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,\" he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. \"It can be a daily nightmare,\" he said. \"I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.\" Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his \"14th winter\" on the bicycle is worth it to save \"several thousands of pounds a year\" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. \"I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,\" he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. \"But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,\" he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be \"excessive\", and instead travelled to London a few times a month. \"Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London,\" he said.", "text": "The number of UK workers making daily commutes of more than two hours to and from work has more than doubled in the past five years, official figures show.", "id": "38026625", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The number of UK workers making daily commutes of more than two hours to and from work has more than doubled in the past five years.", "Official figures show the increase in the number of UK workers making daily commutes of more than two hours to and from work."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.5012405724264681}}

They secured a place in the last four when Wales Under-19 international Woodburn, aged 17 years and 45 days, fired in the second to beat Owen's record by 98 days. Liverpool hit a post through Georginio Wijnaldum shortly before the opener, but the scoreline was somewhat harsh on the Yorkshire side. Leeds winger Kemar Roofe curled against the inside of a post shortly after half-time. Hadi Sacko spurned a good opportunity for the visitors in the opening 10 minutes, and Kyle Bartley nodded a free header wide after the break. Liverpool will find out who they play in the semi-finals when the draw is made after Wednesday's matches. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp might have claimed his team has \"unfinished business\" in the EFL Cup, but this competition is clearly not the German's priority this season as the Reds chase the Premier League title and a Champions League return. And that has been clear by his team selections. Klopp, like he did in the earlier rounds, rotated his team by bringing in fringe players and a handful of youngsters, though that was forced in part by the absence of Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana through injury. Without that attacking threat, the home side lacked fluency and potency in the final third until they clicked in the final 15 minutes to reach a record 17th League Cup semi-final. However, a laboured night was capped when Woodburn - on as a second-half substitute having made his debut on Saturday against Sunderland - beat Owen's record by 98 days. It was a special moment for the youngster in front of the Kop and former England striker Owen, who was watching from the main stand. Every one of Woodburn's outfield team-mates came to celebrate the historic moment as Anfield saluted their latest star. Matches between these two clubs may be rare in the modern era - but this is a fixture steeped in history. A rivalry born in the days of Bill Shankly and Don Revie, resurrected in the eras of Kenny Dalglish and Howard Wilkinson, consigned to longer memories post-Gerard Houllier and David O'Leary. And it attracted the imagination of both sets of fans, Leeds bringing almost 5,500 to a capacity crowd of 53,000. While this tie did not have the allure of a title-swinging league match or Wembley cup final of previous eras, it did provide an opportunity for Leeds to test themselves again at the highest level. Following a turbulent few seasons under Italian owner Massimo Cellino, there is a cautious optimism among Whites fans that their club may - finally - push for promotion back to the Premier League this season. Manager Garry Monk has provided a calm guidance rarely seen - or allowed - under Cellino's control, moving the club up to fifth in the Championship after four wins in their past five matches. The odds were stacked heavily in favour of the home side prior to kick-off, but the visitors created several decent opportunities against a casual Reds defence. Ultimately, they lost with a fight. But the reception given by the away fans to their players at the final whistle suggests they are optimistic a 13-year absence from the Premier League may be coming to an end in the near future. Leeds United manager Garry Monk:. \"I asked them to play in slightly different way to what we have been doing tactically, which we had to do against a very good side. \"We followed it to a tee. It just lacked us taking one of quite a few opportunities. We had the best chances of the game. \"It needed a bit more composure, that's the only negative. Better decision-making in the final third and we would have had a couple of goals. Overall I was gutted for the players. \"As a performance for a young, inexperienced team these type of nights set a marker for you. We're growing. We are disappointed but they will look back in time and think we have put on a good performance. \"I'm not going to criticise my team - they were excellent.\" Back to a Premier League title push for Liverpool. The Reds, who are a point behind leaders Chelsea, travel to 12th-placed Bournemouth on Sunday at 13:30 GMT.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The legend of Emperor Yu states that he tamed the flooded Yellow River by dredging and redirecting its channels, thereby laying the foundations for the Xia dynasty and Chinese civilisation. Previously, no scientific evidence had been found for a corresponding flood. But now a Chinese-led team has placed just such an event at about 1,900BC. Writing in Science Magazine, the researchers describe a cataclysmic event in which a huge dam, dumped across the Jishi Gorge by a landslide, blocked the Yellow River for six to nine months. When the dam burst, up to 16 cubic kilometres of water inundated the lowlands downstream. The evidence for this sequence of events comes from sediments left by the dammed lake, high up the sides of Jishi Gorge, as well as deposits left kilometres downstream by the subsequent flood. Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong, from Nanjing Normal University, said he and colleagues stumbled on sediments from the ancient dam during fieldwork in 2007. \"It inspired us to connect the next possible outburst flood with the abandonment of the prehistoric Lajia site 25km downstream,\" he told journalists in a teleconference. \"But at that time we had no idea what the evidence of a catastrophic outburst flood should be.\" The Lajia site, famously home to the world's oldest noodles, is known as China's Pompeii; its cave dwellings and many cultural artefacts were buried by a major earthquake. \"In July 2008 I suddenly realised that the so-called black sand previously revealed by archaeologists at the Lajia site could be, in fact, the deposits from our outburst flood,\" Dr Wu said. \"The subsequent investigation confirmed this speculation and showed that the sediments from this outburst flood are up to 20m thick, and up to 50m higher than the Yellow River - indicating an unprecedented, devastating flood.\" He and his colleagues suggest in their paper that the very same earthquake that destroyed the Lajia dwellings probably dammed the river upstream. Less than a year later, the waters returned with a vengeance. \"The flood was about 300-500,000 cubic metres per second,\" said co-author Dr Darryl Granger, from Purdue University in the US. \"That's roughly equivalent to the largest flood ever measured on the Amazon river; it's among the largest known floods to have happened on Earth during the past 10,000 years.\" Using carbon dating - on flood deposits and even on fragments of bone from earthquake victims at Lajia - the researchers date the megaflood to 1,922BC, \"plus or minus about 28 years\", Dr Granger said. If the flood was indeed the source of the Emperor Yu legend then the founding of the Xia dynasty presumably occurred within a few decades, in about 1,900BC. This date is 200-300 years later than many previous estimations. But Emperor Yu's tale is difficult to pin down using traditional historical sources; the story survived as oral history for a millennium and its first known written record dates to around 1,000BC. On the other hand a later, circa 1,900 commencement for the Xia supports that idea that this first dynasty coincided with the transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age ways of living. Some archaeologists have already linked the Xia dynasty with the Erlitou culture, an early Bronze Age society known from digs elsewhere in the Yellow River valley. Dr David Cohen from National Taiwan University, another co-author, said the study was remarkable because of the multiple lines of evidence involved. \"We have the geological evidence of just a huge outburst flood, which is incredible in itself,\" he said. \"But then there's this coincidence of it co-occurring with the destruction of the Lajia site - which is able to give us very, very precise dates\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and then that this flood was of such a scale and corresponds in time, and along the Yellow River, with both the beginnings of Bronze Age civilisation and the legend of the great flood itself. \"It's just this amazing story. All these different approaches coming together - it is just great luck.\" Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington is a geomorphologist with an interest in what rocks can tell us about ancient myths and legends. He was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary for the journal and discussed the findings on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action. Among the world's various flood myths, Prof Montgomery said, Emperor Yu's story is an odd one. \"It's not about surviving. His basic story is about draining the flood waters; it's about river engineering.\" The case made for the Jishi Gorge megaflood is a plausible one, he said, particularly because it describes a flood that would have broken the Yellow River's banks far downstream and re-routed its flow. Prof Montgomery said this is just the sort of event that would take decades to deal with - and a long battle with the waters is a feature of the Yu myth. \"It's very difficult to ever actually prove the origin of pre-written history events. But they've made a very interesting case, that I'm sure geologists will continue to poke at, and investigate, and argue about - because that's what we do.\" At a purely geological level, he added, the flood is a major and intriguing discovery. \"But the cultural connection - possibly explaining the origin of the Chinese flood story - is too intriguing to ignore.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.", "text": "An ancient Chinese legend about a great flood that dates back more than 1,000 years has been linked to one of the largest floods on Earth, according to new research.", "id": "36966274", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["An ancient Chinese legend about a great flood dates back more than 1,000 years.", "The legend has been linked to one of the largest floods on Earth.", "New research suggests that the legend is linked to one of the largest floods on Earth."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9990027546882629}}

After returning from the Shanghai Masters in October, Murray said he arrived at the National Training Centre in London to find no other players present. \"I was there on a Monday at about 3pm and then on Tuesday, at the same time,\" he said. \"There was not one person using any of the indoor courts and not one person in the gym. I took photos of it because the place cost like \u00a340m and there are no people.\" Prior to Murray's comments, Smith said the LTA needed to quickly create a long-term strategy to capitalise on his team's victory.

He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. \"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's \u00c2\u00a35 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than \u00c2\u00a34 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"", "text": "Harry Pincher, who has died at the age of 100, was one of Britain's best-known and most influential journalists.", "id": "27209454", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Harry Pincher has died at the age of 100.", "Harry Pincher was one of Britain's best-known and most influential journalists."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.09658928436692804}}

A police car reportedly came under fire and a person was hurt in an apparently unrelated shooting in the same area. Black teenager Michael Brown was shot by a white policeman on 9 August. The shooting of the 18-year-old as he walked down a street drew allegations of police brutality among people in the mainly black suburb of Ferguson. A riot erupted on Friday night, with local stores targeted by looters, after police named the officer who shot Mr Brown and also released CCTV from a shop where he apparently stole a pack of cigars and intimidated the owner just before his death. A five-hour curfew, running from midnight (05:00 GMT), was imposed in response. US civil rights leader Al Sharpton has said a peaceful rally, led by Michael Brown's family, is planned for later on Sunday. The teenager's killing caused dismay across the US, with peaceful nationwide vigils held on Thursday night, while images of riot police deployed in an American city suburb have made headlines worldwide. Seven arrests were made when police moved to break up the protest at a barbecue restaurant. Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was put in charge of bringing calm back to Ferguson, said police had moved in after receiving a report of people breaking into the restaurant and climbing on to the roof. As police were nearing the restaurant, a man with a handgun went into the street but ran away, AP news agency reports. Someone also shot at a police car but it was not clear if it had been hit. In the same area, a person was shot and critically wounded and police were searching for the attacker. Demonstrators complained that the curfew would make matters worse. As police prepared to move on the protesters during the night, a chant of \"No justice! No curfew!\" could be heard from the crowd, followed by \"We have the right to assemble peacefully\". Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward the police before tear gas was fired, was quoted as saying by AP: \"They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.\" Local politician Antonio French, who was with the protesters, tweeted to say: \"Too many young men talking about they're ready to die tonight.\" Governor Jay Nixon said he would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community. \"This is a test,\" he said. \"The eyes of the world are watching. We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.\" The US justice department is investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, with 40 FBI agents dispatched to Ferguson to gather information. Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson revealed on Friday that the officer who shot Mr Brown was Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him. Mr Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Commenting on the CCTV footage that was released, Chief Jackson said that Mr Wilson had not known Mr Brown was a robbery suspect. The policeman had reportedly stopped the teenager for walking in the street, disrupting traffic. Mr Brown's family condemned the release of the footage as a police attempt to \"justify the execution-style murder\".", "text": "Police in the US state of Missouri have fired tear gas and used water cannon to break up a protest against a curfew imposed after the killing of a black teenager by a police officer.", "id": "28824157", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Police in the US state of Missouri fired tear gas.", "Police in the US state of Missouri used water cannon.", "The protest was against a curfew imposed after the killing of a black teenager by a police officer."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.5892372578382492}}

She plays a no-nonsense character in House of Cards, and in real life Robin Wright is no different. For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity. \"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male\u2014the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\" she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's. \"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public\u2026and they did.'\" Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare. \"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue. \"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\" US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (\u00a327,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one). When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. \"They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less,\" she explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more. \"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started.\" \"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident,\" she says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the \"79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%. \"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter. \"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women,\" she says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed. \"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called \"pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them. But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up. \"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history. \"But it has to be unacceptable at this stage.\" Follow Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv.", "text": "Robin Wright, star of the hit US TV series House of Cards, has spoken out about the pay gap between men and women in the workplace, and how she used her role in the show to fight for equality.", "id": "36327826", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Robin Wright is the star of the hit US TV series House of Cards.", "Robin Wright has spoken out about the pay gap between men and women in the workplace.", "Robin Wright used her role in the show to fight for equality."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9978819886843363}}

One of the few women to receive a mention is Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who basically discovered radiation and helped apply it in the field of X-rays. She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize. The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community. The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964. Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel\". But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness. Here are just a few. Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics. She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work. Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer. Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work. Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics. It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table. She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium. But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory. Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission. Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two. This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb. After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades. But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author. And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom. Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century. She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today. In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head. This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played. Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe. She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women. Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth. This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness. The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president. It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation. Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity. It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women. That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.", "text": "The Nobel Prize in physics has been awarded to more than 1,000 men and women since it was first awarded in 1901, and most of them have been men.", "id": "33157396", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The Nobel Prize in physics has been awarded to more than 1,000 men and women since it was first awarded in 1901.", "Most of the men and women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.5050529660657048}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The fratricide within the Republican Party is getting much of the national attention, but the two remaining Democratic candidates - and their supporters - are starting to swing some sharp elbows. The Wisconsin primary on Tuesday marks the beginning of the Democratic presidential campaign's endgame. More than half the pledged delegates have already been apportioned, and only a few truly landscape-altering battlegrounds - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California - remain on the calendar. Mr Sanders can claim momentum, with wins in five of the last six contests, but he needs a sizeable victory in Wisconsin if he wants to properly set the stage for the critical coming contests and cut into Mrs Clinton's 263 delegate lead. It's enough to set both candidates on edge. On Thursday, when confronted by a Greenpeace activist in New York about whether she could address climate change while taking donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mrs Clinton showed a rare flash of anger. \"I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me,\" she said. Her campaign would later assert that the former secretary of state, like Mr Sanders, takes donations from individuals employed in the energy sector but is prohibited from accepting money from corporations. It was a moment of emotion for a usually carefully controlled candidate - and the Sanders camp quickly responded. \"If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine,\" Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said. \"But to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary's fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\" It was just one of numerous recent shots between the two campaigns. When Mrs Clinton unveiled manufacturing proposals on Friday, a Sanders spokesperson said the former secretary of state has embraced \"policies that have decimated the manufacturing industry ... and eliminated millions of jobs across the country\". Trump's disastrous women voter problem - This voting bloc could doom in chances in the general election. #BernieMadeMeWhite: Minority supporters of Sanders speak out - Supporters push back against \"all-white\" narrative. Trump, Clinton and the 'None of the Above' era - Rarely have those running for high office been held in such low esteem. Full US election coverage from the BBC. At a campaign event, Mr Sanders offered criticisms of Mrs Clinton's six-figure speeches to Wall Street firms, her foreign policy views and her position on environmental issues, as his supporters heartily booed. On Saturday Mrs Clinton noted that she has been a \"proud Democrat my adult life\" - drawing a contrast with Mr Sanders, who is a self identified \"democratic socialist\" who serves in Congress as an independent. \"I think that is kind of important if we are selecting someone to be the Democratic nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Mrs Clinton said. \"I think the secretary is getting very nervous,\" Mr Sanders countered on Sunday, noting that polls show him doing better than Mrs Clinton against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. \"I think we've got a lot of young people's vote, working-class people's vote,\" Mr Sanders said. \"I think we're on the way to a victory if we can win the Democratic nomination.\" This tension in the Democrat race is a relatively recent development. Last autumn, Mr Sanders famously said during the first debate that he was \"sick and tired\" of talking about Mrs Clinton's email server imbroglio - passing on a chance to target what could have been a key weakness in his main opponent. When Mr Sanders entered the race, he said he wasn't interested in running a negative political campaign. It was a strategic decision that has led to some recent second-guessing among advisers within the candidate's campaign, as witnessed by a surprisingly pessimistic story in the New York Times on Monday. \"The central complication with Bernie is that he never wanted to cross into the zone of personal attacks because it would undercut his brand,\" Sanders adviser Tad Devine told the Times. That hasn't stopped acrimony from flaring among the two candidates' supporters, however - even in typically restrained states like Wisconsin. Lisa Stubek, a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign, says she's caught fire from pro-Sanders constituents in the ultra-liberal state capital of Madison. \"Bernie Sanders supporters are pretty relentless, unfortunately, as far as their support and as far as attacking those who support anyone but their candidate,\" she said. \"And that's not true of everyone, but certainly there is a core group of Bernie Sanders supporters here in Madison who do that.\" While Ms Stubek says that the campaign has largely been above-the-board, things have taken a turn for the worse. \"I think certainly when you have Bernie Sanders out there stretching the truth or out-and-out lying, things do heat up,\" she said. \"I'm glad that Hillary is out there defending her record. More than anything people in our state want the facts.\" Another Madison-area Democratic representative, Melissa Sargent, says she decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in part because the noise between the two candidates would drown out her efforts to address other issues and local campaigns. \"When I go to doors and I'm stumping for my local candidates, I can talk about the things that I want to talk about and I can hear authentically what folks are saying,\" she said. \"It felt like I wouldn't be able to navigate the path that I am with these other races.\" Democrats in Wisconsin are quick to note that their challenges are nothing compared to what the Republicans are facing, as their two leading candidates engage in harsh negative attacks and exchange barbs over their wives and marital infidelity. Brett Hulsey, a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders, called the Republican campaign a \"food fight circus\". \"Democrats are still fighting by the Queensberry Rules,\" he said, drawing a boxing analogy. He cautions that while tempers seem to be flaring among Democrats at this point, things will eventually calm down. If Mrs Clinton wins, he plans to support her - and he predicts most Sanders backers will follow suit. \"We're in the middle of the fray right now,\" he said. \"I remind everybody to take a few deep breaths and remain calm. I've worked every presidential since 1980 for Jimmy Carter. I've seen this movie before.\" At a rally in Madison on Sunday night it seemed an era of good feelings may have returned. Mr Sanders spoke to a crowd of 4,200 for more than an hour and made no mention of his Democratic opponent. Instead, he focused his criticism on Mr Trump and Republican Governor (and former candidate) Scott Walker. He also seemed to be broadening his perspective. \"This campaign is about more than just electing a president of the United States, although I would very much appreciate your support,\" he said. \"It's about creating a political revolution.\" After the event, Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign - said she appreciated that Mr Sanders has tried to run a positive campaign. \"He continues to pull focus back to the message and back to our strength in unifying, coming together instead of dividing and bringing anyone down,\" she said. On the campaign trail in Janesville on Monday, however, Mr Sanders was back to swiping at his opponent for her past positions on international trade and commerce. \"I have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" Mr Sanders said. \"Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one.\" The Democratic race is far from a bare-knuckle fight, but the candidates aren't done trying to draw blood.", "text": "The US presidential election campaign is in full swing, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders locked in a tight race for the Democratic nomination.", "id": "35962179", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The US presidential election campaign is in full swing.", "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are locked in a tight race for the Democratic nomination."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9973031282424927}}

The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country. Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity, with black Canadians the most common target. Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion. Canada's Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group, accounting for 13% of all incidents, despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes. Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the data \"disturbing and clear\". He also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all its forms. \"An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,\" he said. Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015, with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014, accounting for 12% of all incidents. However, Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) to encourage reporting. Incidents targeting Catholics also increased, jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents. Almost 40% of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents, which could include assault and uttering threats. Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate-related violence. In a news conference following the report's release, the NCCM's legal counsel, Khalid Elgazzar, pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as \"a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities\". The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting. The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada. They suggest that only about 35% of hate crimes are actually reported to police.", "text": "The number of reported hate crimes in Canada rose in 2015, with black Canadians the most commonly targeted group, according to a new report.", "id": "40252489", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The number of reported hate crimes in Canada rose in 2015.", "Black Canadians were the most commonly targeted group.", "A new report shows that the number of reported hate crimes in Canada rose in 2015."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9988173246383667}}

He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a \"manoeuvre\". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. \"We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership,\" he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying.

He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group.

Writing in Lancet Global Health, they predict cases will rise from 36 million to 115 million by 2050, if treatment is not improved by better funding. A growing ageing population is behind the rising numbers. Some of the highest rates of blindness and vision impairment are in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of the world's population with visual impairments is actually falling, according to the study. But because the global population is growing and more people are living well into old age, researchers predict the number of people with sight problems will soar in the coming decades. Analysis of data from 188 countries suggests there are more than 200 million people with moderate to severe vision impairment. That figure is expected to rise to more than 550 million by 2050. \"Even mild visual impairment can significantly impact a person's life,\" said lead author Prof Rupert Bourne, from Anglia Ruskin University. \"For example, reducing their independence... as it often means people are barred from driving.\" He said it also limited people's educational and economic opportunities. The worst affected areas for visual impairment are in South and East Asia. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa also have particularly high rates. The study calls for better investment in treatments, such as cataract surgery, and ensuring people have access to appropriate vision-correcting glasses. Prof Rupert Bourne said: \"Interventions provide some of the largest returns on investment. \"They are some of the most easily implemented interventions in developing regions.\" \"They are cheap, require little infrastructure and countries recover their costs as people enter back into the workforce,\" he said. The charity Sightsavers, which works in more than thirty countries to try to eliminate avoidable blindness, says it is seeing a rise in conditions such as cataracts, where the eye's lens clouds over. \"Due to an ageing population and a rise in chronic disease, we expect the burden of blindness to only grow within the world's poorest countries\" said Imran Khan from the charity.

This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.", "text": "Michael Horan has been elected as the new president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) at the annual congress in Dublin.", "id": "39084080", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Michael Horan has been elected as the new president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).", "Michael Horan was elected as the new president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) at the annual congress in Dublin."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.868315577507019}}

Her step-mother, First Lady Melania Trump, has so far chosen to stay in New York with Mr Trump's youngest son. Ms Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told AP news agency: \"Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not.\" But some have criticised the decision to give her a White House position, even though she will have no actual job title. Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: \"I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. \"But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues.\" The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions. But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's \"special hiring authority\". Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times. However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling. Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter. Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an \"unfair advantage\" in the marketplace. She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration. Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms Trump is due to release a book - Women Who Work - in May, with the proceeds going to charity, Ms Gorelick said.", "text": "US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump has been named a senior White House adviser, the first adult child of a US president to work in the White House.", "id": "39335887", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump has been named a senior White House adviser.", "Ivanka Trump is the first adult child of a US president to work in the White House."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9665261805057526}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run. He is looking for a number two who can balance his weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give him a second look, and campaign effectively on his behalf. All the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine him on the stump or otherwise detract attention from him. The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes. As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:. Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes. The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit. He is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election. Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget. But Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes. Mr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term. Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush. In selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket. But Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit. Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative. In 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007. In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich. Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a \"Sam's Club Republican\" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart). Mr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media. He could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally. But he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956. Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for \"cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children. Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992. He rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008. Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket. But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House. When Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith. And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language. Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate. Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters. Mr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing. Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Mr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time. His national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response. Before entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC. While in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, he was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008. John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004. The two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates. Mr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them. In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the \"trenches\" of the Senate. Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school.

I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited...  and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no\". Now, however, Mr Huckabee's heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He'll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn't have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security.

The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores by sea in the first seven months of 2015. Ms Olcay said the items would be bought elsewhere if she did not sell them. Admitting that she was taking part in the trade, she alleged that local Turkish authorities were also involved.

His inquiries brought him to a large store, with a French flag flying outside and a sign at the entrance saying \"French honorary consul\". Ms Olcay confirmed she was the consul, and that she sold boats to the migrants despite knowing it could lead to disaster. She told the reporter that it was wrong but everyone was doing it.

After telling this to his audience at Perth's Southern Fried Festival, Inverness resident Judi Menabney came forward and offered to find the grave. Salvona's resting place has since been found in Tomnahurich Cemetery. Owens' research of his family tree influenced the writing of Dora, a track on his Nashville-recorded album Into the Sea. The song is about his grandmother, Dora Salvona Owens, who grew up in a circus that Salvona started in Scotland. Salvona was thought to have arrived in Scotland from Italy in the company of a dancing bear, sometime in the late 19th Century. Owens' lyrics of the song include the lines: \"Somewhere way back there's a lion tamer/Ambrose and his dancing bear/He's buried in the Highlands/but we're not sure where.\" Ms Menabney works for High Life Highland, an organisation that runs archives, registration and family history services on Highland Council's behalf. With help from her colleagues at the Highland Archive and Registration Centre in Inverness she was able to find the grave in one of the city's largest cemeteries. Family historian Anne Fraser said: \"It was great fun investigating Ambrose's story. \"He turns out to have been a very colourful character - which may not be a surprise - but we have also finished up raising as many questions as we've answered.\" The staff at the centre found out that Salvona was married twice and was the father of at least 10 children. He was 80 when he first arrived in Inverness and was, at the end of his life at the age of 88, a resident of a poor house that later became Hilton Hospital and is today a block of flats. Salvona appears to been a popular figure in the Highland town. A procession of people carried his body to a prominent position at Tomnahurich following his death on 13 October 1917. The inscription on the gravestone acknowledges his career as a lion tamer. Owens said: \"I can't believe the final resting place of my great great grandfather has been found. \"I'm very grateful to Judi, Anne and their colleagues for all the work they've put into discovering his story. \"I'm delighted they want to use it and my song Dora - which started the search - in their own presentations.\" The singer added: \"You really don't know what's up there, way up in the family tree.

The fingerprints of Anis Abid Sardar, from Wembley, London, were allegedly found on two other bombs at the scene, but not that which killed Sgt Johnson. Mr Sardar, 38, denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: \"This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will see and hear comes from Iraq. \"The Crown's case is that the defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007. \"As you will hear, he seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city Damascus at relevant times.\" He explained that although the offences took place in Iraq, Mr Sardar is on trial in London as a British citizen. Mr Hill said the bombs \"were not off-the-shelf bombs, they were made with deadly intent\". They were later taken to an FBI laboratory in the US for examination by experts. Sgt Johnson, of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was killed when the armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit a roadside improvised explosive device (IED). Other US soldiers were seriously injured by the blast and also in a fire-fight while dealing with another IED, the court heard. Fingerprints found on the bomb that killed Sgt Johnson belonged to another man, Sajjad Adnan, who worked with Mr Sardar, the prosecution said. Mr Adnan, who is not British, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after the bombings and his current whereabouts are unknown, Mr Hill said. Jurors heard Mr Sardar was part of a group that left a number of IEDs buried under the roads west of Baghdad. The bomb that killed Sgt Johnson was part of a sequence, Mr Hill told the court, \"involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together\". Mr Hill said the bomb series was part of a  \"joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others\". \"That is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left his own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sgt Johnson,\" he said. The prosecution made clear that this was an \"unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence... comes from Iraq.\" Nevertheless it is, according to them, lawful to try Anis Sardar here because he is a British citizen who lives and works in London. It is the first time we have seen a prosecution in this country for charges of making improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the insurgency in Iraq. This has been a case a long time in gestation, since Mr Sardar was arrested seven years after the bombs were recovered from a dusty road west of Baghdad. The jury was told they were forensically analysed by the US authorities in Iraq and America before being examined by British scientists. Though Mr Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria in 2007 to learn Arabic, the court heard that police found documents in his London home which suggested he already had an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found a bomb-making manual written in Arabic. The US-led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, amid claims Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures. But Hanson Academy claims it \"communicated clearly\" its expectations for this school year. Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers. Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed. Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.

As part of the deal to sell 24-year-old De Gea to Real, United were planning to bring Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas, 28, in the opposite direction. There is no precedent for Spanish clubs being given additional time to conclude transfers as there is in England. Blame for the failure to complete the deal is already being apportioned. Reports in Spain claim United were responsible for the deal collapsing. The line is they did not get their paperwork to Spanish Football Federation headquarters until a minute after the 23:00 BST deadline. United say they have a receipt that proves they submitted the relevant documents in time. It remains to be seen whether Real will appeal to world governing body Fifa, which is responsible for sanctioning international transfers. The internet naturally had its say... And the tweets only intensified once stories of a technical glitch at the Madrid end began to surface... If Real Madrid don't appeal, or do appeal and fail to push the transfer through, he'll be back at Old Trafford competing for a place in the United starting line-up. Sergio Romero, the Argentina number one, has started all six of United's games so far this season, with Sam Johnstone on the substitutes' bench. The Red Devils still have Victor Valdes after his move to Besiktas collapsed, but he has fallen out with manager Louis van Gaal. De Gea, who has not played for United this season, must first turn his attention to international duty with Spain. They have two Euro 2016 qualifying matches to negotiate, at home to Slovakia on 5 September and in Macedonia on 8 September. They seem pretty relaxed about it all. If De Gea stays, they have a world-class keeper to call on. If he goes, the Navas deal could still happen. Unlike Real, United have a few more hours to do their business. The transfer window may be shut in Spain, but it remains open until 18:00 BST on Tuesday for Premier League clubs. Monday was mostly about letting players leave... But the move that caught a lot of people by surprise involved a French teenager named Anthony Martial. It appears United are willing to pay as much as \u00a336m to get him. A 19-year-old Monaco striker with plenty of potential. He has even been likened to Thierry Henry. Nevertheless, \u00a336m is a lot to pay for a teenager. According to French football journalist Philippe Auclair, the size of the transfer fee has left \"people speechless in France\". \"He's got good technique, good skills, he's a good finisher, but he is still a raw product,\" added Auclair. \"We don't know how far he can go.\"", "text": "Manchester United have failed to complete the signing of Spain goalkeeper David de Gea from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a deal that was due to be completed on Monday night, but the transfer window is still open in Spain.", "id": "34108093", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Manchester United failed to complete the signing of Spain goalkeeper David de Gea from Manchester United to Real Madrid.", "David de Gea was signed from Manchester United to Real Madrid.", "The signing was due to be completed on Monday night.", "The transfer window is still open in Spain."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.48423014029685874}}

Satisfaction with the work of councils is highest in North East England - but still less than one in three are happy. People have rated councils better than national government in past studies. Voters will go to the polls on 5 May to elect more than 9,500 councillors in nearly 280 councils across England. Research by polling firm YouGov, designed to coincide with the election campaign, has suggested that the majority of voters casting their ballots next month will do so not knowing any of the candidates. It asked more than 2,000 people aged over 18 across the UK whether they could name any of their local councillors. Recognition was highest in Scotland, where 47% of those canvassed were able to identify one of their local representatives. In Northern Ireland, the figure was 46%, while in Wales, the figure was 44%. Across the English regions, recognition was highest in the North East of England - at 43%. But in six regions - the East Midlands, the East of England, the West Midlands, London, the south west of England and the south east - less than one in three of those asked could identify the person representing them. Asked whether the local authority addressed the needs of their local communities, only 20% of people living in the North West of England said it did. Approval levels were highest in the North East (31%), the West Midlands (28%) and Wales (27%). Social networking site Streetlife, which commissioned the research, suggested it demonstrated there was a \"real disconnection\" between residents of local communities and those representing them. The findings contrast with those of the Hansard Society, whose recent audit of political engagement concluded that awareness and satisfaction with local politics had increased since last year's general election. It found that more than two out of three people were interested in how local services were provided and nearly half believed they were being delivered well - much higher than at a national level. The Hansard Society also found name recognition was also a problem for national politicians, with only 38% of people able to name their own MP.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Ministers shelved Wednesday's vote on relaxing hunting laws in England and Wales after the SNP said it would vote against the changes. The party had previously said it would not vote on issues affecting England and Wales only. Mr Cameron said the SNP's position was \"entirely opportunistic\". Downing Street said it was \"disappointing\" that the vote had to be postponed, and said new proposals on the Hunting Act would be introduced \"in due course\". The government has said the hunting vote will now be held after plans to give English MPs a veto on matters affecting only England - although this would not stop the hunting issue having to be voted on by the whole House of Commons. Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the decision to delay the hunting vote showed \"David Cameron can't carry his own parliamentary group\", and that he only had a \"slender and fragile\" majority. She said he had also been forced to pull his English votes for English laws plans, showing that he was \"not master of all he surveys in the House of Commons\". She said if he \"had any sense\", he would come back with proposals based on \"fairness and reasonableness\" that \"work in both directions\". Earlier she had explained her party's decision to take part in the hunting vote, saying there had been \"overwhelming demand\" from people in England. Another reason, she said, was because David Cameron was making Scottish MPs \"second-class citizens\" in the House of Commons. Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent. With two strategic retreats in the space of a week, the intersection of Hunting and English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) is generating some really interesting politics. Last week, the government paused its attempt to bring in EVEL, replacing a vote on Wednesday with a consultative debate. Today another \"turn your back and run away, and live to fight another day\" moment on the proposed changes to the Hunting Act. Read the blog in full. The government plans to change Commons rules to allow English, or English and Welsh, MPs a \"decisive say\" on legislation only applying there. However, the current proposals would not prevent SNP MPs from voting against the changes. Downing Street said there were no plans to change the current proposals. This is because the statutory instrument ministers want to use to change the law would require the support of the whole of the House of Commons. The government's decision to reschedule the vote came as anti-hunting protesters gathered at the Houses of Parliament to protest against changing the law. The changes would have brought the Hunting Act in line with Scotland, where an unlimited number of dogs can be used to \"flush out\" a fox to be shot, compared to just two in England and Wales. It's been a rollercoaster week for the old, bitter enemies on each side of this debate. Last Wednesday - Budget day - there was quiet jubilation in hunts in England and Wales at the prospect of the loathed Hunting Act being relaxed. Dignity would be restored: they could hunt without their every move being filmed. Animal welfare groups were devastated: it was a sneaky step, hunting would be back, and they only had a week to mobilise. Now with the abandonment of the vote, their fortunes have apparently been reversed. But this isn't a tale of victory and defeat. Both sides now know the government's desire to change the Hunting Act. They are digging in for a much more protracted fight that could - believe it or not - become even more bitter. But the 56 SNP MPs, plus Labour and some Conservative MPs opposed to hunting, meant the government's change stood little chance of being approved in Wednesday's free vote. The SNP says it will now consider tightening the law in Scotland to match England and Wales. Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said: \"David Cameron is now running scared because he knew he was going to lose the vote on fox-hunting.\" Meanwhile, a poll for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show has suggested almost three in four British adults are against making fox hunting legal.

However, in the US Lord Amherst has become a dubious figure because of his connection with biological warfare. Earlier this year students at liberal arts institution Amherst College, Massachusetts, voted to remove 'Lord Jeff' as their unofficial mascot in light of accusations he approved the wiping out of Native Americans by deliberately giving them smallpox via infected blankets. As the commander-in-chief of the British army in pre-independence north America, Jeffery Amherst is said to have \"both despised and hated his enemy\" according to the historian Henry Morse Stephens. In a postscript to a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet, he appears to have written: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race. \"I should be very glad your scheme for hunting them down by dogs could take effect, but England is at too great a distance to think of that at present.\" Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University have faced student protests because of their association with another colonial figure, the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes.  The 'Rhodes Must Fall' campaign led to UCT removing a statue of the 19th Century politician. Professor Elizabeth Fenn, an historian at the University of Colorado, who researched the Amherst smallpox incident told the BBC: \"I am relieved and delighted to see the wholehearted rejection of Jeffery Amherst. \"He advocated genocide, the 'total erxtirpation' of native peoples. The question we should ask is why did it take us so long?\" In Montreal more than 6,500 people signed an online petition to rename the city's Amherst Street after a former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, who died in 2015. The campaign, launched that year, continues. Some researchers have argued that the British general deserves an honourable position in history for his personal achievements, one of which was the capture of Montreal in 1760. Morse Stephens wrote: \"Though not a great man... his personal qualities were undeniable, and he could not have been an ordinary man to have risen from page to Duke of Dorset to be field-marshal commanding-in-chief.\" Whether Sir Jeffery Amherst ever visited Guernsey during his time as governor of the island is not known, but his legacy lives on today in several places; Amherst Primary School, Amherst Road and the Amherst Room at Castle Cornet. There was an Amherst Maternity Hospital in St Peter Port but the site was redeveloped for housing. Local historian, Colonel Richard Graham, said that Lord Amherst had been viewed as a national hero \"in whose reflected glory Guernsey bathed over the 24 years of his time in office\". So have recent events overseas had any bearing on the general's reputation in Guernsey? Mr Graham said historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged by the standards of their time. \"I believe strongly that they should be judged and accepted by the mores of the time they lived rather than by ours. \"In a hundred years' time, our actions will be similarly scrutinised and there will be some judgemental souls who will see evil in stuff we currently regard as harmless. \"That is not to say that hideous conduct as seen in the evils of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot are any the less hideous for having taken place when they did and within the world as it was. \"But even these abominations need to be explained and understood as if from their time if the appropriate lessons are to be drawn from history.\" The island's Education Department and a St Peter Port Parish official told the BBC that no one had approached them about renaming local places called Amherst.", "text": "Sir Jeffery Amherst, the British general who led the British army in pre-independence north America in the 17th Century, has been honoured with a number of places being named after him.", "id": "35763632", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Sir Jeffery Amherst led the British army in pre-independence North America in the 17th Century.", "A number of places have been named after Sir Jeffery Amherst."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.49955164606217295}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65% to 17% majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38% of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5% of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23% - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56% - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish\". That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72% to just 7%. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97% Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99% Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99% Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92% Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51% Protestant backing and 36% Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44% backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35% wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10% told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2% opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73% of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64% of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45% of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.", "text": "A BBC Spotlight survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll suggests a majority of people in Northern Ireland would back staying in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow.", "id": "21345997", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A BBC Spotlight survey was conducted for the BBC Spotlight programme.", "The survey was about the potential outcome of a border poll.", "A majority of people in Northern Ireland would back staying in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9961643616358439}}

The star is also set for a US number one, after selling roughly 450,000 downloads in 48 hours. The song's video, which also premiered on Friday, has been watched more than 70 million times on YouTube. Directed by Canadian film-maker Xavier Dolan, the video sees Adele raking the coals of a faded relationship. Her ex-boyfriend is played in flashback scenes by Tristan Wilds, a former child actor from acclaimed crime series The Wire, who released his own Grammy-nominated album,  New York: A Love Story, in 2013. According to Entertainment Weekly, it is also the first music video to be shot with large-format IMAX cameras. Hello is the lead single from Adele's third album, 25, which is due out on 20 November. Reviews for the single have been overwhelmingly positive. The Guardian called it \"striking, witty and lovelorn\"; while the Telegraph described it as \"a beautiful song of loss and regret\". Following its release on Friday, it topped the iTunes chart in 102 countries, and the album topped the pre-order chart in 93 countries. In the UK, Hello is expected to have the biggest opening week of the year, beating Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do, which achieved 173,000 combined sales and streams in February. The star could also smash a US record for selling the most downloads in a single week - set in 2009 when Flo Rida's Right Round was bought 636,000 times. Such figures emphasise the importance of Adele's career in an ailing music industry. She is one of the remaining few artists - others include Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Ed Sheeran - who can convince fans to pay for their records. Her last album, 21, sold 30 million copies worldwide, and it is hoped that its follow-up, 25, will mirror that success. If so, it could help reverse figures from the first half of this year, which showed that sales of both CDs and digital albums had fallen in the UK. But, speaking last Friday, Adele told the BBC she was not feeling the weight of expectation. \"I feel like every album I'm ever going to write is always going to be following 21,\" she said. \"No matter what this album does, my next record's going to be following 21. \"It's phenomenal what happened with that - but it is a phenomenon.

Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. \"Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,\" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are \"pervasive\" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. \"We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,\" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. \"When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy,\" Walsh blogged.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The finding was one of the takeaways from a US central bank survey of more than 6,640 adults published on Friday. In total, the number of respondents with no more than a high-school diploma who said they were \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay\" fell to 60% from 61%. Overall, the annual survey showed US economic health improving. Some 70% of respondents said they were either \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay,\" up from 69% the year before, and 62% in 2013 when the Federal Reserve started the survey. But there were continuing signs of instability, with over a third of US households (35%) saying they could not cover their monthly bills or an unexpected $400 (\u00c2\u00a3307) expense, according to the survey. The survey also suggested that disparities between households with different education levels was growing. Gap between rich and poor 'keeps growing' Enriching the rich in the US - but what about the rest? \"A clear pattern over the past two years across these measures is that the improvements have been most pronounced among those with greater levels of education,\" researchers wrote in the report. Nearly 100 million Americans have no education beyond high school, according to US government estimates. (The estimate excludes members of the military and people in institutional facilities such as prison.) That fact is tied to wide differences, the survey found. About 46% of adults with at least a college degree reported family incomes of $100,000 or more, compared to just 9% of respondents with a high school degree or less. Adults with at least a college degree were more likely to report earning money from online activities - such as renting out properties using a website - and more likely to have a steady stream of income from month-to-month. They were also more likely to say they received a raise in the last year, and more likely to say it exceeded the growth in their expenses. \"The thing is that earnings are so highly correlated with education and employment,\" said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. \"It's hard to imagine how a sense of financial wellbeing would not be correlated with education.\" Jobs in sectors that once supplied well-paid work for school leavers,  such as manufacturing, have fallen. At the same time, the overall labour market has become more unstable as employers cut back on benefits and pay rises. The share of Americans in the workforce is also shrinking - particularly among those with lower levels of education, said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"The workers we would expect to have the strongest labour attachments have actually been becoming less attached,\" she said. Among survey respondents who did not attend college, nearly 40% said it was too expensive or that they needed to earn money. Their status was also closely tied to whether their parents had attended college. But Ms Baum said simply getting everyone to go to college is not the solution. \"There could be more work done to equalise things at the level of higher education but the problem is never going to be solved just at the college level,\" she said.", "text": "Americans with at least a college degree are more likely to say they are \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay\", according to the Federal Reserve's annual survey.", "id": "39979176", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Americans with at least a college degree are more likely to say they are 'living comfortably' or 'doing okay'.", "The Federal Reserve's annual survey found that Americans with at least a college degree are more likely to say they are 'living comfortably' or 'doing okay'."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.2995156943798065}}

The violence is the first in Beirut since the conflict began in neighbouring Syria in March last year. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the incident shows how divided the Lebanese are over the Syrian crisis. It follows a week of clashes in the northern city of Tripoli between anti-Syrian Sunnis and Alawites who support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria, the dominant partner, had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years, finally withdrawing soldiers in 2005, but maintaining a strong influence. Political factions in Lebanon have often defined themselves as pro- or anti-Syrian. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut. Given how deeply and sharply Lebanon is divided over Syria, it's a miracle that there hasn't been much more violence than there has. But the killing of two Sunni clerics at a Lebanese Army checkpoint in the north of the country on Sunday could hardly pass without consequence - though the fallout could have been much greater. Only in Beirut did the tension break into open conflict. And it was restricted to a clash between Sunni groups, with the mainstream Future faction of Saad al-Hariri using the occasion to squeeze out the small, pro-Syrian Arab Movement Party, whose leader Shaker Berjawi fled. In nearby areas of south Beirut, Hezbollah - the most powerful force in the land - kept well out of it. Political and religious leaders from all sides urged restraint, while the government pledged a vigorous enquiry into the death of the two shaikhs. Divisions over Syria are the defining issue in Lebanese politics. Everybody knows how real the danger is that the country would be torn apart if those differences are allowed to erupt freely onto the streets. Sunday's violence was triggered by the shooting dead of two Sunni sheikhs linked to the anti-Syrian Future movement, headed by opposition leader Saad al-Hariri, at a Lebanese army checkpoint in the north on Sunday. Supporters of Mr Hariri responded by blocking main roads with burning car tyres, but security forces intervened to clear them. In Beirut's southern district of Tariq al-Jadideh, offices of a local pro-Syrian leader came under attack by gunmen. Rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire were heard for much of the night. But the clashes died away after the leader, Shaker Berjawi, left the area, and the Lebanese Army moved in. Sunni religious and political leaders have called for the utmost restraint, and an investigation has been launched into the killing of the two sheikhs.

But the manifesto stretches far beyond the initial nine point plan, with a huge document some 194 pages long. Plaid promises to save 10,000 lives between 2016 and 2026 through a range of measures, including action on public health actions and promoting individual lifestyle changes. They include ensuring earlier diagnosis of disease and better access to life-saving treatments. \"Overall we will reduce preventable deaths by 25% by 2026,\" the manifesto says. And in a major shake-up to how the NHS is run, Plaid says it will fully integrate primary, community and adult social care. It says it would create a \"National Network of Acute and Specialist Hospitals\", and consult on whether this will be run directly by the Welsh Government's Department of Health or by an arms-length NHS Board. Community health services, such as GPs' surgeries, district nurses and mental health, would be run by local government. Local health boards would be replaced with a \"Community NHS\" system delivered through new Regional Combined Authorities - new strategic bodies that will provide strategic planning for local government. Plaid Cymru thinks the current tuition fee grant scheme is unsustainable and wants to end it and replace it with an entirely new system.

Plaid also wants to:. Plaid Cymru promises a \"national economic plan\" to put Wales on a par with the rest of the UK \"within a generation\".

As well as that, the manifesto promises to restore the Welsh Development Agency to promote trade and investment in Wales. Plaid says it would:. Plaid Cymru is backing the blue route \"or a variation of it\" to improve the M4. It also says it will invest in improvements to the A55. It also pledges to:. Plaid says it will \"produce proposals\" for the reform of the present council tax system into a domestic property tax, which the party says would be fairer for those in less expensive properties. Partial powers on income tax are due to be devolved in the next assembly term - and Plaid is pledging not to increase it.

Plaid also promising to raise the stamp duty threshold from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3145,000, which the manifesto says would remove \"over half of all buyers out of tax altogether\".

Its attorney general says the new version is fundamentally the same as the first, calling it \"Muslim Ban 2.0\". The directive, which takes effect on 16 March, places a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on all refugees. The previous order, which was blocked by a federal court, sparked confusion at airports and mass protests. \"Nothing of substance has changed: There is the same blanket ban on entry from Muslim-majority countries (minus one),\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said of the new order. It will bar entry of citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. Iraq, which was included in the first ban, has been taken off the list. Mr Chin also said the directive included \"the same sweeping shutdown of refugee admissions (absent one exception) and lawless warren of exceptions and waivers\", despite the changes made. The new order lifts an indefinite ban on those from Syria. It will also no longer affect legal US permanent residents, and drops controversial language about giving priority to religious minorities. These amendments were introduced in response to legal complaints, which saw the first order blocked by US federal courts. Judges ruled that the ban was unconstitutional amid concerns it unfairly targeted Muslims, something the government denied. Hawaii was among a number of states who filed lawsuits against the original ban saying it would harm residents, businesses and schools. It filed a fresh complaint late on Wednesday, calling for an emergency block on the new order. A hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect. President Trump has not yet commented on Hawaii's latest legal bid, but has previously insisted he has the right to enact such an executive order and hit out at \"so political\" courts. Speaking to local news channel Khon 2, Mr Chin said the new ban had the same \"nation-of-origin discrimination problems\" as the first. He said this was a particularly sensitive issue in Hawaii because of memories of Japanese internment camps on the Pacific island during World War Two. Although the new directive sought to answer legal complaints, Mr Chin said it still constituted a \"Muslim ban\" because of the countries involved and statements from administration officials. In justifying the ban on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said there are more than 300 refugees under investigation for potential terror offences. But no further details were given. The US appeals court previously criticised the government for failing to provide \"evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order\" had committed a terrorist attack in the US.", "text": "The US state of Hawaii has filed a legal challenge to President Donald Trump's new executive order on immigration, days before it is due to go into effect.", "id": "39215990", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The US state of Hawaii filed a legal challenge to President Donald Trump's new executive order on immigration.", "The legal challenge was filed days before it is due to go into effect."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.8556545972824097}}

Eleven care workers are to be sentenced later for the maltreatment and neglect of five patients at Winterbourne View. But a BBC Inside Out West investigation has found evidence of alleged abuse involving different staff members. Police have agreed the assault on Ben Pullar was \"not acceptable\" but said they would not re-open the case. Mr Pullar is autistic and bi-polar, with severe learning difficulties, and when he was 18, he spent almost a year at Winterbourne View from July 2009. He lost two teeth when he was punched in the face. His twin, Tom, said his behaviour changed drastically after going to the hospital. \"He's burst out crying on me and demanded to talk about Winterbourne View - and this is two years after Winterbourne View - so it still affects him today,\" said the 21-year-old. The BBC has seen daily care notes from his time at the hospital which state Mr Pullar \"had an accident with his teeth\" just weeks after he arrived. His family said they were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point he had \"bitten the floor\". He was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of his injuries. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said: \"I think they thought the injury he sustained wasn't consistent with what they were being told. \"He had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from him biting that carer. \"[But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch or a blow to the front of the face.\" The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted, but his family was not invited. Tom Pullar said: \"I think that care staff are supposed to care for patients, not punch them.\" Notes obtained by Inside Out said the nurse was bitten and retaliated in order to remove his fingers - and later, that he had pushed and pulled to get them out. The nurse involved, Maxwell Nyamukapa, was suspended and later reinstated. Despite repeated attempts to contact Mr Nyamukapa, he has refused to comment. The police logged it as an assault, and said the nurse had acted instinctively and in self-defence. Forty concerns were raised about patients in just over three years with the local safeguarding board run by South Gloucestershire Council. The police were also contacted 29 times, nine of those times related to carers suspected of using restraint of involved in violent incidents with patients - including Mr Pullar. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: \"We have carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at Winterbourne View and no stone has been left unturned. \"We consulted with the CPS and our partners in terms of action we could take. \"Looking back on that incident now and understanding the whole pattern of what was happening at that residential hospital, it is clearly not acceptable. \"However, at the time, the officer was dealing with information, reliable information, that came from patients and carers, and that came from other experts in that field. And perhaps they relied upon that information too much.\" She added: \"We accept that there is learning for us as an organisation and we will do things differently in future.\" Det Ch Supt Rolfe said the force had carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at the hospital and had improved how it dealt with people with learning disabilities. The council has declined to comment on Mr Pullar's case. Castlebeck, the hospital's owner at the time, said its new board and management had already, and would continue to, rigorously review what happened at Winterbourne View. The firm said if any other matters come to light, immediate action would be taken and the appropriate authorities informed.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory. Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.", "text": "Nigeria's main opposition party has suffered its biggest defeat since the end of military rule, in elections for state governors and state assemblies.", "id": "32280676", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Nigeria's main opposition party suffered its biggest defeat since the end of military rule.", "The defeat occurred in elections for state governors and state assemblies."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9980073869228363}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "On Saturday, sirens sounded for a third consecutive day warning of an incoming rocket fired from Gaza. People spending the Jewish Sabbath by the beach were sent rushing for cover. The Israeli military used its Iron Dome defence system to intercept and destroy the missile. A fifth battery had been added to it, just outside the city, only hours earlier. After the explosion, close to the coast, a small black cloud was left hanging in the sky over the sea. Tel Aviv is Israel's largest city and commercial centre but it is also a popular place to relax or party. However, despite the sunshine, outdoor restaurants, parks and pavements were much quieter over the weekend. It has taken a psychological adjustment for locals to realise that they too are now within the firing range of certain Palestinian rockets - believed to be the Iranian-made Fajr-5, which can reach up to 75km (45 miles). \"For Tel Aviv people this is a bit of a shock. The rockets hit all the time in the north and south of Israel but in Tel Aviv this never happens. I've lived here for ten years,\" said a jogger, Tzipi. Soli, who was carrying his little daughter, remarked: \"Everyone is talking about it. You can see the streets are emptier than usual and this is from just a few missiles.\" But he said there was broad support for the continuing military offensive in the Gaza Strip. \"I'm not happy with the situation where we are bombing Gaza but I think we have to do it, we have to defend ourselves,\" he said. A retired man, Amos, agreed that Palestinian militants posed a real threat. \"We have to finish this problem. This is the language they understand, not the language of peace,\" he said. Asked about the government decision to authorise the call-up of up to 75,000 military reservists, he gave his strong approval. \"We have the force. We need to have it,\" he said. \"I'm sorry about it but this is our life, our destiny.\" With Israeli troops continuing to head towards the Gaza border and speculation about a possible ground invasion, this is a difficult time for families with members serving in the military. \"I'm very worried because my son is doing his national service. He will go south,\" one man said as his wife's eyes filled with tears. \"This is what happens, I cry every time I think of my son,\" she added. The Israeli military, which has its vast headquarters in Tel Aviv, told the BBC that its offensive was putting Hamas, which governs Gaza, \"under great pressure\". However, spokeswoman Avital Leibovich confirmed that incursions still remained a possibility. \"We are getting ready for an option of ground operation. It's not decided yet but it's an option we're considering at this point,\" she said. \"Some troops were asked to approach specific areas surrounding the Gaza Strip.

He came under criticism after the state department press corps was not taken along with him on his trip to Asia. The IJR's Erin McPike was the only reporter allowed to travel with him. The state department said this was because of the size of the plane. But in the interview Mr Tillerson said: \"I'm not a big media press access person. I personally don't need it. \"I understand it's important to get the message of what we're doing out, but I also think there's only a purpose in getting the message out when there's something to be done.\" Mr Tillerson has also been criticised for his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But when the subject came up in the interview, the IJR said: \"He was so cagey when Russia came up, for example, that his answer wasn't even worthy of inclusion.\"", "text": "US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said he was \"convinced\" by his wife to take up the job by President Donald Trump, who asked him to be his secretary of state.", "id": "39351493", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was 'convinced' by his wife to take up the job by President Donald Trump.", "President Donald Trump asked Rex Tillerson to be his secretary of state."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9986857175827026}}

The Republic of Ireland currently has strict abortion laws, which only allow a pregnancy to be terminated if there is a serious risk to a woman's life. The Citizens' Assembly voted 64% to 36% in favour of having no restrictions. Anti-abortion groups have condemned the result of the vote, but any change to the law would require a referendum. The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Oireachtas (Irish Houses of Parliament) to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas facing the Irish people. These include abortion, climate change and how the Republic of Ireland deals with the challenge of providing for its aging population. The body is made up of 99 members who were chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate. Its most controversial task was to consider a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution - which gives an equal right to life to a pregnant woman and an unborn child. Assembly members held 10 days of intensive and emotive debates over the past five months, culminating in this weekend's series of votes. On Saturday, members voted against repealing the Eighth Amendment, but they did support change - voting to amend or replace the law. On Sunday, a majority of Citizens' Assembly members approved 13 separate grounds for legal terminations in the Republic of Ireland. Of the votes cast, 89% were in favour of allowing abortion on grounds of rape or fatal foetal abnormality - when doctors believe an unborn child is likely to die before, during or shortly after birth. There was less support for legal terminations for \"socio-economic reasons\" but still, 72% of members who took part voted in favour of abortion in those circumstances. However, anti-abortion campaigners dismissed the results of the ballots as a \"muddled and confused farce\". Cora Sherlock of the Pro Life Campaign accused the assembly of having a \"chaotic\" and \"one-sided approach\" in how it conducted its business from the beginning. She added: \"There is nothing liberal or progressive about the assembly recommending a referendum to strip unborn babies of their right to life in law and also ignoring the negative consequences of abortion for women.\" The Citizens' Assembly is chaired by the Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who will now present a report on members' recommendations to the Oireachtas by late June. In a statement, the chair said members had \"reached a conclusion of sorts\" and she thanked them for having \"engaged with some of the most complex pieces of legislation, immersed themselves in medical and ethical discourse, and listened with respect to the voices and opinions of others\". \"I also wish to acknowledge those whose perspectives or opinions did not emerge in the final vote,\" the judge added. \"This is an exercise in deliberative democracy and their vote remains important to me because of the very fact it captures that other perspective, that dissenting voice, the different interpretation and I wish to assure them that their votes and voices will be recorded and have a place in the report.\" On receipt of her report, elected representatives will consider members' calls for a change in the law, and whether or not to hold a referendum.", "text": "A majority of members of the Republic of Ireland's Citizens' Assembly have voted in favour of a change in the country's abortion laws.", "id": "39687584", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A majority of members of the Republic of Ireland's Citizens' Assembly voted in favour of a change in the country's abortion laws."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.998864471912384}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The Times Educational Supplement (TES) says measures to guard against grade inflation were not appropriate for this year's English exams. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of \"regulatory failure\" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the  grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were \"too lenient\". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as \"comparable outcomes\" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject \"must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years\". But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the \"attainment profile\" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be \"fit for purpose\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was \"not fit for purpose\". The third condition was that the \"nature of the qualification\" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that \"these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways\". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where \"previous grades were appropriate\". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were \"too generous\". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: \"Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations.\" The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: \"Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. \"In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess.\" And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be \"another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose\". Meanwhile, Ofqual said: \"The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. \"Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. \"What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report.\" But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. \"The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. \"Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is 'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action.

The scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster in 2012 when she was enterprise minister. Its aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed. The plan by the economy minister has now been formally submitted to the Department of Finance for approval. Mr Hamilton and Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir held talks on the issue last week. Analysis: BBC News NI's Business Correspondent Julian O'Neill. The BBC understands the plan involves a two-staged approach. First, it would reduce the tariffs paid to around 1,800 people who got into the scheme before November 2015. This would require an Assembly vote to change the tariffs from the new financial year starting in April. Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a longer-term solution. But there remains an acceptance within the Department for the Economy that any moves on tariffs could face a legal challenge. It is understood that a significant number of RHI recipients have told the Department for the Economy they do not wish their names made public. The department had written to them asking for views on their names being released. Mrs Foster and Mr Hamilton have talked of wanting transparency about who benefited. It is believed the department is taking legal advice on its options. The failure of the political parties to find a resolution on how to investigate the failings in the scheme has led to a political crisis at Stormont. Martin McGuinness resigned on Monday as deputy first minister in protest against the botched handling of the scheme and, after Mrs Foster refused to step aside while an investigation was held. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, Mrs Foster loses her first minister role with the departure of Mr McGuinness. The Sinn F\u00e9in MLA's decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election. The party has seven days to nominate a new deputy first minister, but is adamant it will not replace him.

It was a debut try for forward Savelio, who only joined the Tigers on loan from St Helens on Wednesday, but Cas lost Rangi Chase with a back problem while Super League's leading try scorer winger Denny Solomona pulled out with food poisoning..

At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Stewart, 48, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, was also told to repay \u00a327,000. The court previously heard that Stewart worked in the accounts department of Ivanhoe Cambridge UK, which sold the St Enoch Centre in 2013. Between May 2008 and January 2011 she had managers at the firm sign cheques that were supposed to be used to make legitimate payments. Stewart would then write over the payee name and insert the football team's name. The money would go to the club before Stewart took it for herself. She was caught after a bank spotted a problem with one of the cheques from Ivanhoe Cambridge and phoned her office. Stewart then immediately confessed to her superiors and a payment plan was put in place for her to repay the money. The court heard that although more than \u00a35,000 was repaid, the plan was not completed and her house was put on the market. The house was rendered worthless due to Japanese Knotweed, and Stewart was later reported to police. Stewart appeared for sentencing on Thursday having earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzling the money. The court heard that Stewart's husband had been jailed in 2003 for three-and-a-half years for drug dealing and she had resorted to theft to repay the debts that he wracked up.

Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the A&E department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director.

In 2012, Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust admitted staff negligence. At London's High Court earlier it was ruled the trust will pay a tax-free sum every year for the rest of Ayla's life. Mr Justice Warby ruled the organisation must pay an index-linked amount starting at \u00a3225,000 and rising to \u00a3290,000 when she turns 18. While admitting it was at fault, the trust had disputed the value of the claim for damages. It has been providing financial assistance to the family since 2012. Ayla, now eight, is totally immobile and dependent on being fed through a tube. The court was told she is at constant risk of hypothermia as she cannot control her body temperature. Despite her immobility, she suffers muscle spasms that leave her \"screaming inconsolably at the top of her voice for hours\". Painkillers do not stop the pain, which can only be quelled by immersion in a hydrotherapy pool. Ayla's father now works in London and the settlement includes \u00a31.6m to buy a family home in Richmond. Further money will be needed to adapt it to Ayla's needs and install a hydrotherapy pool. The judge awarded a \u00a3295,000 lump sum for Ayla's pain, suffering and disability and he paid tribute to her parents for the \"calm and intelligent way\" they had dealt with the tragedy. Trust medical director David Walker said: \"We are very sorry for the harm caused to Ayla and the distress caused to her family as a result of the issues arising from her birth. \"The injuries she suffered are very severe and a tragedy for her and her family.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. Here are four examples:. Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\". However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\". While there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country. He later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents. \"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" He says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\". A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\". In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. He adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\". It is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.", "text": "The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been accused of trying to meddle in the affairs of several African countries over the past 50 years, according to a BBC investigation.", "id": "36303327", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been accused of trying to meddle in the affairs of several African countries over the past 50 years.", "A BBC investigation found that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) tried to meddle in the affairs of several African countries over the past 50 years."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.8246724307537079}}

Bailly joined Villarreal for \u00a34.4m in January 2015 and played in every game as Ivory Coast won the Africa Cup of Nations just weeks later. It had been thought Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be Mourinho's first signing since the Portuguese succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager. The Sweden striker, 34, is a free agent after leaving Paris St-Germain and hinted at the weekend he would make an announcement about his future on Tuesday. But he has refused to elaborate, saying: \"There is no confirmation. Keep wondering. I am enjoying the stories.\" Bailly's reputation has soared this season, which saw him play a key role as Villarreal sealed Champions League qualification, and it's no surprise to see him make a big-money move this summer. His prime asset is his extremely impressive physical presence, with his powerful aerial ability complimenting his pace and strength in the tackle. The brave and determined 22-year-old has less than 50 league games under his belt, though, so United fans should perhaps not expect him to immediately become an automatic starter. He can sometimes concede possession in dangerous areas by making bad decisions, and he doesn't always show composure under pressure, but Bailly possesses all the physical tools and the rest should come with more experience.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Across the world, drug laws are being relaxed, from Uruguay to Portugal, Jamaica and the Czech Republic. Does this mean the war on drugs has been lost? The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses, including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer. After many years prosecuting drugs offences as an Assistant US Attorney, growing frustration with the approach inspired Bonny Klapper to become a defence attorney. \"About 10 years into my career, it really hit me that the people I was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers. They were mothers, they were fathers, and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\" One Colombian drug runner had a big impact:. \"At 14 he had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else.  So he started in the emerald mines, and it was a horrible experience. And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. He started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks. \"In countries like Colombia,  sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don't come from a wealthy family or you're not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\" She noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:. \"[We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia.  We prosecuted one, we shut it down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once they were extradited, someone else came in to take their place. \"We've shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and they're moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\" She argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:. \"The prison system is a disaster. There's virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it. \"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'. \"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs. \"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did. \"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (\u00c2\u00a327bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that. \"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis. \"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\" He cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade. \"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands. \"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place. \"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia.  It's something unreachable.  It's not to recognise human nature.\" Former chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:. \"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves. \"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets. \"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency. \"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished. \"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground. \"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\" Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades. \"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric. \"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself. \"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future. \"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition.  And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome. \"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down.  Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\" As drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:. \"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme. \"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily?', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state. \"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions. \"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising. \"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence. \"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "The Saints boss had been linked with Rangers and Aberdeen in recent months. And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright. \"I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit,\" joked Wright, 53. \"I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here. \"That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.\" As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park. In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership. Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. \"It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here. \"I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in. \"I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.\" Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term. Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad. He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman. \"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. \"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. \"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said. \"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. \"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. \"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). \"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. \"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  \"having good people and a good squad\".

And more recently, Sundar Pichai took over as chief executive of Google - a role many said had been years coming. Indians in California say it's the blend of temperament and competitive spirit that brings success their way. \"If an old school friend starts a company in Silicon Valley,\" one Valley-based Indian tech executive, Mohit Aron, told me, \"I'm going to start an even better one\". Mr Modi continues to ride the strong waves of support back home. A recent US think-tank study suggests 87% of Indians have \"favourable opinions\" of the leader. Outside the stadium, that enthusiasm was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against his government. Those not on \"Team Modi\" are angry at what they see as ignorance towards Mr Modi's past. In particular, they say he did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi's plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, they say that's a front to mass surveillance. A letter, signed by more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi's visit, backed up this concern. They believe the positivity around his leadership, particularly in the Indian press, is more to do with aggression from the government towards its critics. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its his tech-savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most. \"We're very proud,\" said one supporter outside the stadium. The SAP Center is in San Jose, a city that sits at the bottom of Silicon Valley, a region where Indians truly thrive. Some 26% of tech companies here are founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans. That's more than the next five immigrant groups combined. Mr Modi has come here on a mission to bring some of that success, and wealth, back to India. To do it, he needs help. Before India can even begin to think of itself as a genuinely major technology player, it needs to cover the basics. Mr Modi, effortlessly adopting Silicon Valley's obsession with buzzwords, said the country needs both highways and \"i-ways\", by which he meant fibre internet, connecting each and every Indian town and village. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Modi spent time with someone who could help, taking part in a Q&A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It was decidedly more A than Q, mind, as of 40,000 questions submitted to Mr Modi, only three were asked during the session. They covered the rewards of getting online, particularly when it comes to creating jobs. Mr Modi spoke of his delight at his tweets and messages to other world leaders \"going viral\". The last question, from Mr Zuckerberg, asked about Mr Modi's relationship with his mother. Pausing, Mr Modi became emotional as he told of cleaning dishes for those less fortunate. The prime minister even appeared to cry. An elderly Indian lady later told me it made her feel like he was \"just like us\". Those who see Mr Modi less favourably say that was exactly its intention, a staged display designed to build his reputation as a man of the people. The meeting at Facebook was mutually beneficial. Mr Zuckerberg, keen as ever to expand Facebook's user base and global influence, talked up the prospect of connecting a billion more Indians to the internet. In one of the most pointed exchanges in the entire session, Mr Modi said he hoped Mr Zuckerberg's motivations weren't purely about Facebook's bank balance. For Mr Modi, this entire Silicon Valley visit is a chance to put a little pressure on the tech giants. He wants India to graduate from being home to the low-end of the tech trade - call centres and cheap labour - and instead an attractive place to start a technology business. Indeed, he wants India to be a great place to start any kind of business, and reverse the trend of great minds, particularly in tech, heading to California. One parent outside the SAP Center, whose children were dressed in stunning, sparkling saris, said she believed when her girls grow up they will see moving back to India as a career aspiration - in the same way she saw the US as way to a better life.

Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. Prosecutors say he has claimed responsibility for the attack and spent more than a year in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve told Europe 1 radio on Monday: \"There are people who recruit jihadists. There are as I'm speaking arrests being made.\" \"We are acting everywhere. There will be no respite in the fight against terrorists.\" There is no suggestion of a link between the four arrests on Monday and the detention of Mr Nemmouche during a random check on a coach arriving from Amsterdam in southern France on Friday. But Mr Nemmouche is said to have had links with radical Islamists and served five years in jail in France for robbery before being released in December 2012. When he was arrested, he had with him a Kalashnikov rifle and a handgun believed to have been used in the attack, the Paris prosecutor said. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He feared \"they would become 700 time bombs when they return\", referring to the estimated number of French-born jihadists in Syria. Belgium has requested Mr Nemmouche's extradition from France and police have to decide whether to extend his detention until Thursday. Three people died when a gunman opened fire at the museum in the busy Sablon area of the Belgian capital on 24 May. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer.

He encouraged the boy not to try to be tough like his attackers, saying there was \"no shame\" in reading poetry and listening to \"our favourite bands\". \"Dear Romford 15-year-old, who I'll call Ben. I don't know your name, and it's good that I don't, because I am sure you do not want to be associated with that video of the bullies savagely punching you to the ground. Bullies? They are worse than that. I was really shocked by what I saw. Loads of people were disgusted. You are just 15. Ben, something similar happened to me. I was a sensitive young teen, always trying and failing to be cool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 never athletic enough, never hip enough, a late developer, crazy hair, with uncool parents who thought church was the main event. I worshipped indie bands - Joy Division especially - in the way that sensitive souls do. I wanted to be a jock, but I was a nerd. Maybe you recognise that. One day I was at a party and spoke to a girl. Apparently she was the girlfriend of someone important. He sent his friend to beat me up. The friend said: \"Excuse me, can I tell you something?\" And because he was shorter than me I had to lean down to hear him. Having moved my head within range, he punched me as hard as you got punched. I had never been hit before. The shock was unbelievable - violence does that. I went down immediately just like you. My mates, also sensitive souls, were too scared to help. They were gutted afterwards. You feel humiliated. Your pride is hurt, your head is hurt - I had a gigantic black eye. A person can get very down over a beating. Some people think depression evolved in us as a way of keeping us safe if we lose a fight - the mind and body working together to prevent you re-entering the conflict for your own safety. It took me ages before I wasn't scared of being hit again. You look over your shoulder for a while, and you feel a primal fear. That is natural, Ben. So I watched your video and saw myself. That guy who distracted me in 1980 could be the thug who hit you from behind in 2016 - such a coward. Can I give you some advice? Don't think you have to be hard like them. I tried to be a tough teenager afterwards and closed myself off like a drum. I reacted to nothing and felt nothing. Then I got to university and found people like me who would never dream of punching someone, and my life opened up like a flower. A kind lecturer was shocked when I proudly and foolishly told him I had never read a poem. He said, \"We'll change that,\" and helped me understand the power of poetry. One day in my student room I read a poem and cried. I was alive again. Sure, I would never win a fight - I have never hit anyone in my life - but you don't need to hit people to succeed in your life. Quite the opposite. The courts will decide who assaulted you and how to punish them. In our society, what happened to you is thankfully now taken very seriously. But let me tell you something about the lads in the video. In 20 years, when you're with the person you love and hopefully in a career you have a passion for, they will still be scumbags. Their cupboards will smell of gym sweat and cheeseburgers. Each will own one suit which he wore to the funeral of a friend who died doing a wheelie on a motorway - by the way, they all wore the same baffled expression at the funeral service. They've gone from making the weather to being rained on, and they complain about it constantly. They are not something anyone wants to be with - their lives are already over. Five per cent of people are good at fighting. I'm not one and nor are you. It is very important we let the 5% fight each other. Live by the sword, die by the sword: the thug who beat me up was in hospital himself a year later after someone broke a bottle across his face. Meanwhile, you and I can read poetry and listen to our favourite bands, and if we sometimes cry, there is no shame in that. To cry is to live. The people who attacked you are the walking dead. Come into Radio 2 sometime and I'd be happy to show you around.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Under US law, 40% of the corn harvest must be used to make biofuel, a quota which the UN says could contribute to a food crisis around the world. A drought and heatwave across the US has destroyed much of the country's corn crop, driving up prices. The US argues that producing much of its own fuel, rather than importing it, is good for the country. The latest forecasts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggest that this year's corn yield - the amount produced per acre - will be the lowest since 1995-6. Total production will be the lowest for six years, it forecast, due to the extreme heat and dryness. As a result, the USDA is predicting further rises in prices. It now thinks farm prices for corn will average $7.50-$8.90 per bushel, a sharp rise on the $5.40-$6.40 per bushel it predicted just a month ago. By Mark MardellNorth America editor. Writing in the Financial Times, the director general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva, said suspension of the quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production. \"The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply. \"The situation reminds us that even the most advanced agricultural systems are subject to the vagaries of the weather, leading to volatility in supplies and prices, not just on domestic markets, but also internationally.\" Concerns about the impact of the dry weather in the US pushed maize prices up by 23% in July, according to the latest FAO food price index. But the US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the biofuels standard was having a positive impact on the country. \"It is impacting in a positive way the cost of gasoline in this country - some estimates put it at 25 cents to as much as $1.30 less for gas because we have a biofuel industry. \"There are jobs connected to that industry and less reliance on foreign oil. The question is: Is the market responding to concerns about supply and the answer is yes. \"Exports are down just a bit and ethanol production is down from between 10% and 30%, depending on the part of the country.\" By law, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must be produced in the US this year. The country's Renewable Fuel Standard, as the law is known, was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported oil. It has long been controversial, with many blaming the quota for pushing up corn prices. The United Nations is not alone in calling for the quota to be suspended. Livestock producers in the US, worried about the cost of cattle feed, also want it scrapped and the governments of China, India and France have expressed concerns about the policy.", "text": "The United Nations has called for the US to suspend a controversial biofuels quota for its corn crop, which has been blamed for pushing up food prices.", "id": "19206199", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The United Nations called for the US to suspend a controversial biofuels quota for its corn crop.", "The corn crop has been blamed for pushing up food prices."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9912952780723572}}

The pre-tournament favourites - last knocked out of this competition in 1993 - had led when Isabel Kerschowski fired in early on. But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half-time and Theresa Nielsen's late header completed the comeback. It is only Germany's third loss in the 26-year history of the competition. The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous. The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski's fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German's shot in to the net. After the break, Germany hesitated when they thought they had conceded a free-kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser. Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming. Another right-wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and she headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations. The result guaranteed that the tournament will have a different winner for the first time since Norway's triumph in 1993, with Germany having won the following six European Championships.

Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic. \"Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate,\" said the Scotland international. \"There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad. \"I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan.\" The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season. So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland. \"As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world.  But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us. \"Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year.\" Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend. \"The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday. \"We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us.\" Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team. The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order. Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September. \"I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn. \"We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man.\"", "text": "Leigh Griffiths says he and his Celtic team-mates are \"buzzing\" after clinching the Scottish Premiership title, and are already looking forward to next season.", "id": "36198766", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Leigh Griffiths says he and his Celtic team-mates are 'buzzing' after clinching the Scottish Premiership title.", "Leigh Griffiths and his Celtic team-mates are already looking forward to next season."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9370050430297852}}

In a majority of cases there was also no evidence that victims' views were taken into account on key decisions. The CPS said its own data showed a \"markedly different\" picture to the \"small sample\" used in the report. Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate's communicating with victims report looked at the speed and quality of the CPS's communication with victims of crime. As part of its investigation, inspectors visited six of the 13 CPS areas in England and Wales, during a three-week period. They examined 162 case and complaint files and interviewed CPS staff, police and crime commissioners and partner organisations such as Citizens Advice. The Inspectorate said the CPS should be more consistent in the quality of their letters and how quickly they send them to victims, and added the CPS and police should agree on their roles in communicating case outcomes to victims to avoid sending confusing or duplicated information. They also stated the CPS should \"implement an effective process\" for notifying victim liaison units when charges are altered in a case, so that staff can inform victims. Inspectors did say the CPS was facing increased pressure due to staff cuts, and the report also highlighted that the organisation had taken steps to improve service, including drafting new guidance about speaking to witnesses at court to improve the quality of service.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "With delicious timing, Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss's rightward shift on issues like national identity - has released a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide. To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this\" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: \"We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. \"We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it.\" At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, \"proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister\", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's \"narcissistic\" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to \"trophy woman\" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. \"Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile.\" He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says \"did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency\". \"The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency.\" In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. \"The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue.\" The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: \"The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food.\" Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president's 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: \"I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!\" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20,000 (\u00c2\u00a317,000; $22,000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet caf\u00e9 near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance\". He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed\u2026 that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 7/7 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. Det Supt Smith said the relief he felt at the time of the arrests continued today. \"Every day since that time I've thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn't detain him. \"I've always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester.\"", "text": "As Abid Naseer went on trial in the United States for his role in an al-Qaeda terror plot to carry out a \"mass-casualty\" bomb attack in Manchester, BBC News looks at what police believe would have happened if he had not been caught.", "id": "31692375", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Abid Nasser went on trial in the United States for his role in an Al-Qaeda terror plot.", "The plot was to carry out a'mass-casualty' bomb attack in Manchester.", "BBC News looks at what police believe would have happened if he had not been caught."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.3908695975939433}}

Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed \"human rights abuses\". But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover: The allegations made to date. Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: \"It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. \"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future.\" \"Jacqui\", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was \"like an earthquake\". \"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it\". She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, \"and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them\". She hopes \"what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. \"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified.\" The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. \"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one,\" he said. \"Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be\". And Ms Steel said: \"These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge.\" Case study. \"Alison\" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. \"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left,\" Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an \"exit strategy\" used by officers. \"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could,\" she added. She later found out \"Mark\" had a wife and children. \"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. \"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate.\" Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968. The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry's terms of reference include:. The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent. The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London: \"We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people. \"We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.", "text": "An inquiry into claims police spied on political and social justice groups in England and Wales for more than 50 years is likely to \"expose both creditable and discreditable conduct\", Lord Justice Pitchford has said.", "id": "33682768", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["An inquiry into claims police spied on political and social justice groups in England and Wales for more than 50 years is likely to expose creditable conduct.", "Lord Justice Pitchford said the inquiry is likely to expose discreditable conduct."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.03677359223365784}}

But the Stars showed up well in the 4-2 semi-final defeat to Cardiff Devils and the 15-8 third-place match loss to Belfast Giants. \"It's been a great experience for our guys and hopefully next year we can come back here and learn from it, like Cardiff did,\" LeFebvre said. \"I had some time to reflect on Saturday's performance against Cardiff and I'm so proud of my players. It was a dream start for us to go 2-0 up in the first period. \"It was always going to be a tough task keeping that pace up all game against a team like the Devils, who are rightfully league champions. \"But to be the first team from Dundee to make it to this weekend, it's not to be sniffed at and I'm proud of that.\" Dundee could hold their heads high after a great performance against the Devils in Saturday's semi-final, even if it was to end in a 4-2 defeat. Vinny Scarsella teed up Kevin Hart on the blue line and he fired his effort past Devils goalie Ben Bowns to open the scoring. Stars then went two up as Brett Switzer's low diagonal shot beat Bowns at his bottom right hard corner. The Devils started to claw their way back into the game six minutes into the second period as Joey Haddad found space in front of Dundee's goal to finish. The EIHL champions pulled level when Mark Louis reacted quickest to tuck in an equaliser. Devils completed the comeback with nine minutes left as Joey Martin put them 3-2 ahead before Andrew Hotham confirmed their place in Sunday's final with a late empty-net goal. It meant an early start on Sunday for the Stars who had to face fellow beaten semi-finalists Belfast Giants, who had gone down 2-0 to eventual play-off winners Sheffield Steelers. The sides shared 23 goals with Justin Faryna netting two for Dundee, while Kevin Bruijsten, Joey Sides, Mikael Lidhammar, Matt White, Vinny Scarsella and Craig Moore were also on target for Stars. LeFebvre added: \"The third place game was a lot of fun I guess, but overall, we enjoyed the experience of being involved in this weekend. \"Both us and Belfast knew what we were in for in that game on Sunday and the pace of play there would be. It picked up a little bit in the latter stages. \"It's more an exhibition game for the fans. Lots of goals, not a lot of hits and penalties and some skills. But they have to figure something out about that game. \"If the league put something on the line for them, like some extra money, it might improve it as a spectacle and guys might go harder. \"Unfortunately, two teams have to play in that game and on this occasion, it was us and Belfast.

Stephen Beadman, 29, of George Avenue, Ibstock, admitted raping and murdering the teenager at a hearing in April. He and Luke Harlow, 27, also of George Avenue, are on trial at Nottingham Crown Court after both denied a charge of false imprisonment. Harlow had also previously pleaded guilty to sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Kayleigh went willingly to Harlow's flat in Ibstock, Leicestershire on 13 November. She believed they were in a \"secret relationship\" after chatting on Facebook for about a fortnight, the court heard, and had told her family she was staying with her best friend. Harlow - who called himself \"Luke Fun Times Harlow\" online - told the teenager she was his \"princess\" who he would \"love and treasure forever\". \"On that night Kayleigh had been given substantial amounts of alcohol and she had been sexually touched by Luke Harlow,\" said Ms Moore. \"She was underage and he knew it.  He was later to lie about that, pretending to people that she was much older.\" Ms Moore said the false imprisonment charge centred around what happened to Kayleigh between 21:00 and 03:00 BST on 14 and 15 November. Both men are alleged to have held Kayleigh against her will. The jury heard that at one point, Kayleigh had tried to escape Harlow's flat and was seen by a witness leaving the property naked from the waist down. \"What happened to her in that property to make her flee into the night?\" Ms Moore said. \"What we know is that she was chased by Mr Beadman and pinned to the ground. This was seen by somebody from their upstairs window. \"At some point, far from being this drunken, compliant girl, Kayleigh became somebody who wanted to get out of that flat.\" Ms Moore said that the witness mistook Beadman for a policeman. Beadman then took her \"off into the night, where she was raped and murdered by him\". After Beadman had been by interviewed by police for three days and directed officers to a location on the outskirts of Ibstock. Her body was then discovered in thick undergrowth near a stream. Following examinations of Harlow's phone, police discovered he had sought to groom other girls. His intention was to kidnap them, get them drunk, have sex and keep them in his flat, the jury was told. \"Kayleigh Haywood was not the only girl Luke Harlow groomed,\" Ms Moore said. \"She was the last in the line.\" He has also admitted attempting to meet two other underage girls for sexual purposes. Police from across the East Midlands helped with the hunt for the teenager after she went missing on 13 November. A passerby found Kayleigh's smashed phone on the ground in Ibstock.

Tries from Josh Bassett and Ashley Johnson put them back in touching distance at 31-21 before Sale's Will Addison delivered a vital three points. Kurtley Beale scored Wasps' third try 11 minutes from time and that made for a tense finish but Sale held firm. Wasps had been unbeaten in their past six Premiership matches but looked off the pace from early on. Conversely, Sale showed quickly they wanted to make a statement and did so through rugby league covert Solomona. His move from Castleford Tigers has attracted controversy off-the-field, but on it, his hat-trick took his try tally to seven in his first five matches - a new Premiership record. Another new face, South Africa international Willie Le Roux made his Premiership debut for Wasps and the full-back set up Beale's try after coming off the bench.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Mr Kasyanov, a former prime minister, is a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the opposition RPR-Parnas party. Recently Mr Kadyrov called Mr Putin's critics \"enemies\" and \"traitors\". Russian opposition politicians have described the posting as a murder threat. The Chechen leader said Mr Kasyanov was seeking cash in Strasbourg for the opposition. \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" he warned. Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. That message defended one of the Chechens charged over the shooting. A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award. Mr Nemtsov was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin murdered in the past decade. Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally. Mr Kadyrov runs Chechnya with an iron fist - his private militia has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and assassination. He has close ties to Mr Putin, who encouraged him to stamp out a separatist insurgency in Chechnya. Thousands of civilians died in the North Caucasus republic when Russian troops fought the rebels there in the 1990s. The new video is the latest in a series of threatening messages from Mr Kadyrov against Kremlin critics, whom he accuses of working for the West. It shows Mr Kasyanov talking to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist who runs the pro-democracy opposition movement Open Russia. The movement was launched by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The video was posted late on Sunday and has more than 16,000 \"likes\". Mr Kasyanov says he sees it as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation. Ilya Yashin, who co-chairs RPR-Parnas with Mr Kasyanov, called the video \"an open threat to murder Kasyanov\". Another opposition leader, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, echoed that view. On Facebook, Mr Navalny said (in Russian) \"there is no longer any doubt that all such statements in recent weeks and specifically this one were approved by Putin and the Kremlin, and quite probably were inspired by them too\". The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says they key question now is whether Mr Kadyrov is acting on his own initiative. One theory discussed on Russian social media is that he is being used by the Kremlin to intimidate its critics - particularly as growing economic problems raise the potential for protest. Others suggest that Mr Kadyrov is becoming a dangerous loose cannon - a regional leader who believes he is untouchable, our correspondent reports. The phrase \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" is the title of a thriller that Mr Kadyrov says he has filmed, starring himself as a machine gun-toting all-action hero.

Since launching his account in 2013, he has made over 6,000 posts and amassed 1.6m followers. He promotes himself on the site as a devout Muslim and a strong leader. One recent post featured him grappling with a crocodile. This is not the first time he has used Instagram to lash out at the Russian opposition.

The news has also prompted reaction, particularly on social media. Since the news broke 'North Korea' has been mentioned 211,000 times on Twitter and has been among the top trending topics worldwide. So what can be done to prevent North Korea's move escalate to an international crisis? Here are some of your ideas. @martinedobor tweets there should be greater agreement on weapons:. It's saddening and worrying that North Korea says that it carried out an H-bomb test. That claim must be taken seriously by any person who cares about peace. This is a wake up call for the UN to swing into action in full force and stop North Korea's obsession with nuclear bombs. The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya. @Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks:. North Korea needs to be accountable for its actions like any country. It's time for the world to have some serious dialogue with them. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let's invite Kim Jong-un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA. @SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution:. In my opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible.  Unfortunately this may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East.  I have thought deeply about this question for a while now (still am) , with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO.  Kim Jong-un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and that makes him a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK. I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of them using weapons such as these. However, I don't think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming they have been successful in making them. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to them, the retaliation could be much worse. It's best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore them. It's not like many of the countries condemning North Korea's actions have any moral high ground when they themselves are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. It's like a child in a playground showing off their strength, if they are not challenged they won't have the opportunity to show their force in a fight. Mark, Kingswinford, West Midlands, England UK.

After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. \"I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,\" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as \"brilliant\". \"That's what I want to give to youngsters,\" he says. \"Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it.\" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then \"it doesn't matter what age you are\". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. \"Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,\" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). \"The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football.\" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. \"All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,\" Rebecca Sellar explains. \"So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it.\" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport.

But Ms Sturgeon told STV News that any referendum would not been held in 2017. Her predecessor, Alex Salmond, has predicted a vote on independence will be held in the autumn of next year. Ms Sturgeon said: \"There is not going to be an independence referendum in 2017, I don't think there is anybody who thinks that is the case.\" She has previously said a vote on independence will be held if the Scottish government concludes it is the only way to protect Scotland's place in Europe. Ms Sturgeon has urged the UK government to negotiate a so-called soft Brexit and retain its membership of the single market. Failing that, she wants a special arrangement to allow Scotland to stay in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. The first minister's latest comments regarding the timing of a second referendum follow her insistence at the weekend that she is not bluffing on calling a re-run of the 2014 ballot if Scotland's position is ignored. But she has also indicated that a soft Brexit could take the issue off the table in the short-term. Ms Sturgeon told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"We have to ask ourselves in Scotland are we happy to have the direction of our country, the kind of country we want to be, determined by a right-wing Conservative government perhaps for the next 20 years, or do we want to take control of our own future?\" \"That's the case that in those circumstances, I think, it would be right for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide.\" Asked if she was looking at a referendum \"much quicker\" than in five or 10 years' time if there was a hard Brexit, she said: \"I would think, yes. But let me not get away from this point, I'm putting to Theresa May a compromise solution.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said ruling out an independence referendum this year was an \"empty gesture\" by Ms Sturgeon. Accusing the first minister of \"leaving Scotland in limbo\", Ms Davidson added: \"If she's serious about allowing Scotland to move on from constitutional navel-gazing, she should ditch her draft referendum bill immediately.\" Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley said: \"While it is welcome that Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out another independence referendum in 2017, this doesn't come close to ending the uncertainty. \"The first minister should rule out forcing another independence referendum on the people of Scotland altogether, not just for the next twelve months.\" But the Scottish Greens welcomed the Scottish government' commitment to keeping a second referendum on the table.

His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\" Follow our live updates. EU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives. Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were \"full of fear\" because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\". During a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that \"nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. \"All of them would like to go to Germany,\" he said. \"Our job is only to register them.\" Mr Schulz countered: \"What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense. \"To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution.\" European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. He said: \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\" The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece.

A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Mr Pistorius says he mistakenly shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through the door, believing she was a burglar, then broke it down with the bat. The prosecution says he tried to beat down the door and then fired the gun. Mr Pistorius denies intentionally killing Ms Steenkamp in February 2013. Forensic expert Police Colonel Johan Vermeulen also said he thought Mr Pistorius had hit the door with the bat from a low angle, indicating he was not wearing his prosthetic legs at the time. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Pretoria. A big day in the Oscar Pistorius murder case. The defence worked tirelessly to disprove a finding by Colonel Johan Vermeulen, a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service (SAPS). Oscar Pistorius's toilet door stood obtrusively in the courtroom, held up by a white frame, behind it a toilet cubicle. Col Vermeulen, a state witness, told the court that based on the marks on the door and their level Mr Pistorius was on his stumps when he struck the door with a cricket bat. The defence strongly challenged his version, adding that they will present their own expert witness who will prove Mr Pistorius was in fact wearing his prosthetics. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also introduced another dimension to the case, suggesting that the police recklessly handled the crime scene - he pointed to police shoe prints on the door. The forensics from the scene are a make or break for either side. Mr Roux's plan seems to include discrediting the integrity of the evidence collection process. He has already hinted at the possible contamination of the crime scene, placing the SAPS under a rather embarrassing spotlight. This contradicts the athlete's claim that he had been wearing his artificial limbs. Correspondents say whether or not the athlete was on his prosthetic limbs is important because it could match parts of his story that he accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp, or expose inconsistencies in it. The damaged toilet door, with four bullet holes, was examined in the courtroom along with a replica of the toilet cubicle. Forensic evidence on the location from which shots were fired, how they were grouped and their trajectory were presented to the court on Wednesday. Cross-examining, Mr Pistorius' defence team asked forensic expert Col Vermeulen to kneel and lift his feet, which caused him to wobble. The defence team claimed that Mr Pistorius therefore would not have been able to balance on his stumps and break down the door using a cricket bat. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also alleged that police had contaminated the crime scene by stepping on the door. Col Vermeulen argued that if Mr Pistorius was balanced enough to fire a gun, he could also break down a door with a bat. The forensics expert argued that the angle and location of the marks on the door suggested that they had been caused by someone much shorter than him. The defence team argued that a mark on the bottom of the door showed where Mr Pistorius had tried to kick open the door using his prosthetic legs. Col Vermeulen agreed that this was possible. \"The marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots,\" he told the court. The prosecution argues that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat before the shots were fired, but the defence claims it was the other way round. The trial is now halfway through its second week. Earlier on Wednesday, a friend of Mr Pistorius claimed that the star had driven at 200 km/h (124mph) and that he had taken a picture of the speedometer to prove it. The defence team alleged that Darren Fresco was himself driving at the time and had therefore fabricated evidence. On Tuesday, Mr Pistorius' defence team questioned a pathologist's finding that his girlfriend had eaten less than two hours before he killed her. This contradicts the athlete's account that the pair had been in bed for several hours before the shooting. The state is seeking to convince the court that Mr Pistorius and Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, and reality TV star, had an argument before the athlete fired the shots that killed her. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty, the 27-year-old, a national sporting hero dubbed the \"blade runner\", could face life imprisonment.", "text": "South African athlete Oscar Pistorius hit a toilet door with a cricket bat before he fired the shots that killed his girlfriend, a forensics expert has told his murder trial in Pretoria.", "id": "26541765", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["South African athlete Oscar Pistorius hit a toilet door with a cricket bat.", "Oscar Pistorius fired the shots that killed his girlfriend.", "A forensics expert told Oscar Pistorius' murder trial in Pretoria."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9993612170219421}}

The discovery was made as part of an investigation into claims by a local historian that up to 800 babies and young children died at the home and were buried in unmarked graves. Amnesty International has said that archaeological surveys should be carried out at all former mother-and-baby homes in Northern Ireland.

The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses. Max Boykoff founded the Media Climate Change Observatory a decade ago. \"We monitor 50 sources around the world across 25 countries on six continents. We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month. \"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively. \"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]. \"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK. \"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter. \"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute. \"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years. \"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it.  We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'. \"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan:. \"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\" China's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up. \"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it. \"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained. \"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this. \"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act. \"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away. \"We still have this same brain. Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is. \"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages. So if governments or policymakers repeat the same message too often, people just tune out after a while.\" We also tend to tune out when we feel helpless:.

I'm just one person, and there's 7+ billion people on the planet. I just don't have much control over this, so therefore I'm not going to do much about it, because my contribution, even if I did everything, wouldn't make much difference.' \"Most of us who are trying to do something about this have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it's not close enough to our own lives. \"Uncertainty is a really big problem. We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'. \"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests. Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve. \"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page.  It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media. \"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong.  I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science.  I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions. \"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science. \"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable. \"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission. \"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation.  If you want to talk to a parent at the school gate, you talk to them about the health of their child, their experience of the trip to school - wouldn't they be happier walking and cycling? \"Talking about climate change doesn't have to involve 'talking about climate change' to lead us to some really substantial actions. \"We don't need to wear a climate change t-shirt.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

Andrew Reade, 43, admitted preventing the lawful burial of a body and perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to four years and four months in jail. Miss Cherry's cause of death could not be ascertained because of heavy decomposition but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation, as injuries to her neck were detected. Sentencing Reade, Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant could not be held responsible for Miss Cherry's death but what followed was \"inexcusable\". Officers had launched a \"non-body\" murder investigation because Miss Cherry, from Fulwood, Lancashire had not been seen since October 2015. Reade, of Toronto Street, Bolton, told her family they had split up and she had moved to Blackburn. However, police discovered that her unemployment benefits were still being withdrawn in Bolton. When officers arrested Reade on suspicion of murder, he claimed he had panicked upon waking to find his girlfriend dead after they had binged on a cocktail of drugs. The 43-year-old admitted hiding her body and lying to her family and police. He also admitted taking her benefits for several months after her death. In a victim statement to the court, Miss Cherry's daughter said: \"Reade has held her body in a cupboard with things on top of her like she was a piece of rubbish. \"I will never forgive Reade.

EU officials have warned that Turkey's bid to join the bloc would be finished if Ankara restored the death penalty. Mr Erdogan has overseen a crackdown since the coup attempt was quashed. Thousands of police officers, military personnel and judges have been suspended or arrested. Turkey's Western allies have expressed concern and urged President Erdogan to respond in a measured way. But speaking to his supporters on Tuesday morning, the president said Turkey was \"a democratic state run by the rule of law\". He said he was ready to reinstate the death penalty if the Turkish people demanded it and parliament approved the legislation, adding: \"You cannot put aside the people's demands.\" \"Today is there no capital punishment in America? In Russia? In China? In countries around the world? Only in European Union countries is there no capital punishment,\" he said. Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004 as part of its bid to become a member of the EU. On Monday, Mr Erdogan said suggestions that he was using the coup attempt to crack down on his political opponents were \"libel\". \"I'd like to know what a crackdown by Tayyip Erdogan looks like... It's just libel,\" he said. \"If Tayyip Erdogan was an oppressive figure, he wouldn't have won 52% of the vote at the presidential elections.\" Also on Monday, one of the coup's alleged ringleaders, the air force commander Gen Akin Ozturk, appeared in court. The general, who appeared to have several recent injuries, denied any involvement in the uprising. At least 232 people were killed and 1,400 wounded in fighting after rebel troops sealed off bridges in Istanbul, surrounding the city's Ataturk airport and stationed tanks outside the presidential palace in Ankara. Many later surrendered. Officials have blamed the unrest on the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and the \"parallel structure\" they say he has formed to topple the government. Mr Erdogan insists the US should extradite Mr Gulen, warning that it \"should not keep such a terrorist\". US Secretary of State John Kerry has said Turkey would need to provide \"evidence, not allegations\" against Mr Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the plot.

Dr Colton also said he hoped the church would one day recognise same-sex marriages in religious ceremonies. He told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme that it was a very \"divisive\" debate. \"The events in society are moving very rapidly and the church is not at all up to pace with the debate,\" he said. \"I certainly support civil same sex marriage. \"I also recognise that the church of Ireland's definition of marriage is for itself and I adhere to that discipline... but that is not to say that everyone must be required to take the church of Ireland's view of marriage. \"Having said that I'm also among those in the church, and perhaps we're only a minority, albeit a significant one that long to see the day when we can have a discussion -  as we've had discussions over the years on all sorts of other issues about the nature of marriage -  with a view, ultimately, at least to the blessing of same sex couples following civil unions if not to their marriage in church as is happening in other parts of the Anglican communion.\" The Church of Ireland's LGBT affirming group, Changing Attitude Ireland, welcomed the comments. Chairman Dr Richard O'Leary said:  \"The bishop's acknowledgement of the hurt that the church has inflicted on its gay and lesbian members is greatly appreciated especially as it comes on the day we are holding services to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT)\". Last month,  Stormont  rejected same-sex marriage for the third time in 18 months. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK which has not passed a law to introduce same-sex marriage. The first gay marriages have recently taken place in England and Wales, with Scotland due to follow later this year. Ahead of the assembly motion, the Church of Ireland restated its position on same-sex marriage, repeating what was affirmed at its general synod in 2012. \"The Church of Ireland affirms, according to our Lord's teaching, that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and life-long, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side. The Church of Ireland recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage,\" it said. Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland wrote an open letter to all MLAs urging them to reject the  motion. The letter said the motion undermined the principle of equality by applying it \"inappropriately\".", "text": "A Church of Ireland bishop has said the church is \"not up to pace\" with the debate on same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland.", "id": "27460784", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A Church of Ireland bishop said the church is not up to pace with the debate on same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9991203546524048}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. \"Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?\" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. \"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. \"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. \"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. \"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says. \"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. \"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander. \"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed. \"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers. Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself. Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US. This means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet. \"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe. Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer. The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire. \"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan. \"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says. After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially. So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge. Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country. But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning. \"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander. \"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage. \"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"", "text": "The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food, but the popularity of mead in the US has led to a resurgence in interest in the alcoholic beverage.", "id": "24184527", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The mead of the past was often sweet.", "The mead didn't appeal to many drinkers.", "Many drinkers were just looking for something good to pair with food.", "The popularity of mead in the US has led to a resurgence in interest in the alcoholic beverage."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9874906837940216}}
{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days. \"I feel that I am more tired than I was before,\" she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter. \"During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy.\" Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. Their final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments. During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (\u00c2\u00a31.1m; $1.3m). \"Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care. But he argues the experiment still proved \"successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture. \"It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" he says. \"In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that.\" Yet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month. There's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea. \"I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company. He is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after \"reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees. \"I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company. \"It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\" On the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns. \"I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home. \"It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" he suggests. \"This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home.\" Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses. \"A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" he says. \"Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\" \"So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours. \"First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups. \"It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well.\" Listen to Maddy Savage's report on Sweden's experiment with six-hour days on The World Tonight.", "text": "Sweden has become the latest country to experiment with the shortening of the work day, with a series of local and national trials targeting employees with high levels of stress and burnout.", "id": "38843341", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Sweden has become the latest country to experiment with the shortening of the work day.", "A series of local and national trials targeting employees with high levels of stress and burnout."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9884710609912872}}

However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap. Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement. The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace. Alonso said: \"It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead. \"Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure. \"But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade. At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion. Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6. It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag. The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint. Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place. Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier. Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position. Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres. Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap. Vettel said: \"The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking. \"I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.\" Button said: \"It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end. \"When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push. \"It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back. \"But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again.

Gill Grassie, a member of the Law Society of Scotland's intellectual property law committee said: \"We are delighted that the UK government has listened to our concerns. \"This is an important and very welcome step towards the goal that we have been aiming to achieve for the benefit of Scotland's IP rich business community. \"If we can secure the ultimate realisation of this goal sooner rather than later this will give businesses in Scotland, which rely upon patents to protect valuable technologies and innovation, assurance that they will be able to enforce and defend their rights in future in a local court. \"Thus they will be enabled to secure the benefits this will give in terms of costs savings, convenience and certainty.\" The SNP's Pete Wishart, who had campaigned for the change, said it means inventors in Scotland will no longer have to go to a more distant court in London or Europe to enforce their rights. He said: \"This is a fantastic victory for the legal establishment in Scotland.  I raised these concerns through all stages of the intellectual Property Bill and am very pleased that in response to my amendments today the UK government have said that we can secure a divisional court if we can demonstrate demand. \"Not only is there demand in Scotland but there is also centuries of experience, skills and expertise in dealing with patent case in Scotland. \"It would have been patently absurd for Scotland to be denied a divisional patent court with our tradition of invention and creativity and this is great news for all businesses associated with developing our creative economy in Scotland.\" Last year, countries across Europe backed the changes to patent laws designed to help inventors protect their ideas right across the continent.", "text": "The UK government has agreed to allow Scotland to have its own divisional patent court to hear patent cases.", "id": "26557306", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The UK government has agreed to allow Scotland to have its own divisional patent court.", "Scotland will have its own divisional patent court to hear patent cases."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.984063982963562}}

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) says teachers need more training to help them identity and protect girls at risk. At least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM. Campaigners say girls are most at risk of undergoing the procedure during the long summer holidays. The ATL, at its annual conference in Manchester, passed a resolution to lobby politicians to eliminate the practice and to develop resources to advise teachers and support staff on how to tackle the problem. Proposing the motion, Helen Porter, from Berkshire, said school staff should openly discuss the issue with parents. \"Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents, and scrutinising holiday requests and summer holiday plans from members of communities that practise FGM. \"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff. \"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers. \"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?\" Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used. She said the term female circumcision was \"equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary\". Ms Porter said: \"FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated.\" Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: \"We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children. \"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members. \"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete.\" ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities. \"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns.\" Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as \"this very serious form of child abuse\".

On the first anniversary of Storm Desmond, experts say November to January were the wettest three months since UK records began in 1910. Review author Terry Marsh said flooding was \"extensive and repetitive\". Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December, depositing a record month's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day. About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire, while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded. The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. Major storms \"Abigail\", \"Frank\" and \"Gertrude\" also hit the UK last winter. A study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society, found many rivers across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland saw record peak flows during the three-month period. It found the rivers Eden, Tyne and Lune in England saw record peaks of around 1,700 cubic metres per second. Experts say such levels could fill London's Royal Albert Hall in less than a minute. Although last winter's floods were more extreme in scale, flooding in 1947 had a greater impact in terms of homes flooded and crops destroyed, the appraisal found. However, lead author Terry Marsh from CEH said the national scale of last winter's floods were \"the most extreme on record\". \"The associated flooding was both extensive and repetitive, and total river outflows from Great Britain following the passage of Storm Desmond in December exceeded the previous maximum by a substantial margin,\" he said.", "text": "Last winter's floods were \"the most extreme on record\" and the wettest since 1947, according to a new review.", "id": "38204334", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Last winter's floods were the most extreme on record.", "Last winter's floods were the wettest since 1947.", "A new review stated that last winter's floods were the most extreme on record."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.5962066565019389}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "He also suggested they should not be eligible for tax credits. It comes as a survey suggests 77% of Britons want to see immigration cut. The coalition brought in a three month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on 1 January. But Mr Farage, whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years, said the government should go much further. He said the cost of migrants claiming in-work welfare payments, such as child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits, had not been factored in to the government's calculations. \"We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits,\" he told BBC News. And he said lower economic growth was a price worth paying for cutting immigration. \"Even if I thought, which I don't, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson also weighed in to the debate, suggesting the ban on EU citizens claiming benefits should be two years. Labour said it supported the government's three-month ban, which it said was \"reasonable and achievable\". Downing Street said withholding benefits from migrants for longer periods may be illegal. \"We are doing all that we can within the law,\" said a No 10 spokesman. Downing Street also confirmed ministers were examining measures to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit for children in their native countries. The British Social Attitudes Survey suggests more than three-quarters of Britons want to see a cut in immigration - and 56% want to see a major crackdown. Almost half of those surveyed, 47%, thought immigration was bad for the economy, and among the 31% of respondents who said it was good for the economy, half wanted to see immigration reduced anyway. The figures are revealed in a BBC Two documentary called The Truth About Immigration, to be broadcast later on Tuesday. Business Secretary Vince Cable tells the programme the government's target of cutting net migration to below 100,000 by 2015 is \"not helpful\" and will almost certainly not be achieved. Mr Cable, who has sought to distance himself from the net migration target in the past, calling it a Conservative and not a coalition policy, said politicians on all sides must be \"practical\" and accept that net migration cannot be controlled. \"It involves British people emigrating - you can't control that. It involves free movement within the European Union - in and out. It involves British people coming back from overseas who are not immigrants but are counted in the numbers,\" he says. \"Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful. It almost certainly won't achieve the below-100,000 level the Conservatives are setting - so let's be practical about it.\" Labour said the \"gap between the government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence\". Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Mr Cable should toughen up enforcement of the minimum wage and prevent employment agencies recruiting solely from abroad. David Cameron promised to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating -  from more than 250,000 a year to less than 100,000 by the next election in 2015. After some initial success, the latest figures show net migration is on the rise again, going up from 167,000 to 182,000 a year, largely because fewer Britons were emigrating to eurozone countries. Asked last month if that meant it would be impossible to meet his target, Mr Cameron said: \"'I don't accept that.\" \"If you take the whole three-year period [since the election], net immigration is down by around third.\" He said some measures the government had taken, such as closing \"bogus\" colleges and tightening up the rules on family reunion, would take time to have an impact. In Nick Robinson's documentary, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says the Labour government of which he was a prominent member \"got it wrong\" on immigration, \"and I deeply regret it\". Labour MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett adds: \"We didn't spell out in words of one syllable what was happening, partly because of a fear of racism.\" Nigel Farage tells the programme: \"They tried to rubbish us, they tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what they tried to do and actually this has been going on ever since [Enoch] Powell's speech.\" In the so-called \"rivers of blood\" speech, made in 1968, Mr Powell said Britain's immigration policy was like watching a nation \"heaping up its own funeral pyre\". He was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by party leader Edward Heath, who said it was \"inflammatory and liable to damage race relations\". Asked whether he thought Mr Powell had been right, Mr Farage says: \"He was right for the wrong reasons. He was wrong in the sense that he felt that black and white would find it difficult to mix, but unfortunately he's been proved to be right because the sheer numbers that have come into Britain have led to segregation.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson says all political parties now \"promise to control\" immigration because they are \"acutely aware of the high level of public concern\" about it. In the programme, he looks back to a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration. The paper concluded that there was \"little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration\". Its author, former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes, said: \"I think politicians do have to say to individuals who are negatively affected, and let's face it there will be some: 'Yes, we're doing this for the good of our country, and yes you may lose out, but ultimately we still have to do this.' \"Just as we said to the coal miners 30 years ago: 'Sorry we can get our coal a lot cheaper abroad.

Xinjiang is the traditional home of Muslim Uighurs, who speak a distinct language and have different customs to the majority Han population elsewhere in China. Huseyin Guxur, Yusup Wherniyas and Yusup Ehmet were \"deprived of political rights for life\" because of their role in the deadly car crash on Tiananmen Square in October 2013, Xinhua said. \"They masterminded the terrorist attack,\" the news agency added. In the incident, a car rammed into bystanders on the politically important Beijing square before bursting into flames. Two tourists died, along with three of the attackers. Xinhua named some of the other men who were executed along with the Tiananmen attack perpetrators:. Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress exile group, called the executions \"a typical case of the law serving political ends\". Chinese officials often attribute attacks in Xinjiang to Uighur separatists, accusing them of seeking to establish an independent state called East Turkestan. Beijing has recently blamed them for an attack in May at a market in Urumqi, that left at least 31 people dead. It also accused them of being behind a mass knife attack in the southern province of Yunnan in March, in which 29 were killed and more than 130 injured.

In a career spanning four decades, all 32 of her novels appeared in the New York Times bestseller list. The family statement said the writer lived \"a wonderfully full life\", adored by family, friends and readers. \"She was a true inspiration, a trailblazer for women in fiction and a creative force. She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words,\" it added. Collins was diagnosed with stage-four breast cancer six-and-a-half years ago, according to US celebrity magazine People. She told the magazine in her last interview on 14 September that she had told few people about her diagnosis other than her three daughters, and did not regret her decision. \"I did it my way, as Frank Sinatra would say,\" she said. \"I've written five books since the diagnosis, I've lived my life, I've travelled all over the world, I have not turned down book tours and no-one has ever known until now when I feel as though I should come out with it.\" She was in the UK less than a fortnight ago on a promotional tour for her latest book.

Collins said that she \"never felt bashful writing about sex\". \"I think I've helped people's sex lives,\" she said. \"Sex is a driving force in the world so I don't think it's unusual that I write about sex. I try to make it erotic, too.\" Collins had lost her mother, second husband and fiance to cancer.

The judgement by the Strasbourg court on Thursday is binding, meaning that Lithuania, an EU member state, will have to act on it to prevent any similar violation in future. But the judges did not award Mr Paksas compensation, saying their ruling was in itself \"sufficient just satisfaction\". Lithuania was found to have violated Article Three of Protocol One (Right to free elections) in the European Convention on Human Rights.

Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale:. Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country.

While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long-term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that:. Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL's annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made. There were also 9.6m tweets about the event across its three days. Nielsen, who gather audience ratings in the US, reported extremely strong numbers for the very first 9.30am EST kick-off between Detroit and Atlanta in London, so much so that the NFL will repeat the experiment next season. Although some fans showed their disdain for Rice, Peterson and others arrested last year by returning their replica shirts, many still turned up wearing Rice's number 27 jersey and Peterson's number 28 long after their cases made the national press. Despite everything, the NFL remains America's game. So why the appeal in the face of growing off-field problems? Simply put, the NFL is full of great stories, exceptional games and, most importantly, great players. The college version of the game is flourishing as well. Elsewhere in America, the other two major professional leagues - the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) - have suffered with falling television ratings and general popularity over the past few years. Baseball's lack of true star power means it has fallen out of the national conversation, arguably since 1998 and the infamous home-run record chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who have subsequently become embroiled in steroid controversies. The names of baseball's 2014 All Stars, such as Chase Utley, Nelson Cruz and Paul Goldschmidt, do not possess the same pulling power as football stars such as JJ Watt, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Calvin Johnson. Baseball simply is not cool anymore and the appeal for the game has become as much regional as it is national. Jonathan Mahler wrote in the New York Times recently that: \"Baseball has never been healthier\" - in terms of attendance, revenue, and, unlike the NFL and NBA, freedom from labour strife. \"So why does it feel so irrelevant?\" With each team playing 162 games a season, baseball fans tend to watch their own players in action rather than those they have no vested interest in. That is not the case for the NFL. Almost 19m watched the Dallas Cowboys take on the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The NBA has also suffered in the post-Michael Jordan years, with falling attendances and viewing figures. However basketball has been rescued somewhat by the LeBron James effect, while the game, with its ongoing connection with hip hop culture, continues to grow with a younger audience. Along with the phenomenon that is College Basketball's March Madness, it remains a popular sport in America, but continues to be dwarfed by the NFL. The NBA is, according to the Harris Report, America's sixth most popular sport but is struggling with the increase in popularity of soccer and a resurgence in appreciation for ice hockey. It would also be foolish to think that the NFL is the only organisation with off-field problems. Baseball continues to move from one steroid scandal to another, while the NBA has witnessed its own fair share of domestic violence, domestic assault, battery and driving under the influence cases. The NFL is a runaway success train that shows no sign of halting. And while the on-field product remains so good, the off-field issues will be nothing more than a distraction. Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake is representative of millions: \"Football has always been a part of my life. As a football fan and a woman, I believe the NFL needs to take a good, hard look at the way it has handled the epidemic of violence that has rocked the league and the nation. \"But recent events will not keep me from tuning in to catch my Packers. Let's not forget: It is only a small number of NFL players who have committed violent acts against women and children.\" In April's Draft, commissioner Goodell will welcome University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham into the professional ranks, potentially in the first round. Multiple drug arrests and a dismissal from the University of Missouri for allegedly forcing open an apartment door and pushing an 18-year-old woman down a flight of stairs will not stop him being given every opportunity to succeed on the field. Even if he transgresses again, it will be just another problem for America's most popular sport. But a problem it will overcome, have no doubt.", "text": "When Roger Goodell steps down as NFL commissioner at the end of the season, it will be a fitting end to what has been an eventful year for the sport in America.", "id": "31062512", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Roger Goodell steps down as NFL commissioner at the end of the season.", "It will be a fitting end to what has been an eventful year for the sport in America."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.4927153829485178}}

I didn't know that. There's nobody demonstrating.\" The explosions in Bahrain were reported to include a gas cylinder that set a car ablaze in the financial district of the capital Manama.

Some footballers and entertainers have income from image rights paid into offshore accounts without tax deducted. HMRC said dozens of footballers are under investigation for potential irregularities in their tax affairs. Mr Thompson told MPs that on the issue of image rights: \"I think if it was me, I would want to review this... It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law.\" The HMRC's head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation. Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry. She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): \"Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in \u00a3158m in yield.\" Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine. \"Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this,\" she said. The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals. The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency. At the weekend, the PAC's chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill. Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed \u00a310m (\u20ac12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees. The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims. He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules. The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published. HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took \"all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously\" and \"always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided\". The head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier's committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - on Friday.

The Sunday Times says it has no independent evidence Bonar treated the footballers or the other sportspeople. Bonar told the Sunday Times he treated the athletes for medical reasons and not to enhance their performance. There is no suggestion the substances were illegal, but they are banned by sporting bodies.

According to the newspaper, the sportsman - who wishes to remain anonymous - approached Ukad with evidence that alleged Bonar had prescribed him performance-enhancing drugs. Ukad says it did begin an investigation into Bonar but decided he was outside of its jurisdiction as he was not governed by a sport. Ukad also decided not to pass the case to the General Medical Council (GMC) or to contact the doctor.

He added: \"I want to thank all the teams that showed interest. It flatters me incredibly and pushed me to be strong.\" Force India are currently fourth in the constructors' standings. The team had always insisted they had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both him and the team. Perez's career was hanging by a thread when he was dropped by McLaren after one season with them in 2013 but since joining Force India he has scored four podium finishes to add to the three he achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, he has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better-regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified his place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact he brings money to a team to secure his place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in him, but he has decided that Force India is his best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for their ability to produce a competitive car. If they can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, it would be their best finish since the team were in their original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez's decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that they are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner their current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that he was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers. Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari are all retaining the same line-ups as this year and McLaren are promoting their reserve driver in Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne to partner two-time champion Fernando Alonso in 2017. Alonso's current team-mate Jenson Button has decided not to race next year. The team have an option to bring him back in 2018 if they want to, but the 2009 champion said at the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend that it was \"quite possible\" he would not race in F1 again.

Mr Downes said: \"I think I got stabbed when I got dragged out of my house with my jumper over my head. \"A group were kicking my door open and bottles were getting flung. \"I blacked out and ended up in the Western Infirmary suffering from a punctured lung.\" Passing sentence at the High Court in Livingston, Lord Clark told King he had been convicted of assaulting Mr Downes to his severe injury to the danger of his life and of attempting to murder him. \"You tried to force entry to Steven Downes' flat. The door was kicked open and Steven Downes was dragged out of the flat and struck on the head and stabbed,\" he said. \"He had a stab wound to his back, stab wounds to his face and arm and a stab wound to the left side resulting in a collapsed lung and bleeding into his chest cavity. \"The injury to his left arm required to be stapled, the injury to his back was life-threatening and other injuries have resulted in permanent scarring.\" He added:  \"Your repeated involvement in offences involving knives is a very serious matter. \"The report notes you are beginning to develop a pattern of knife-carrying which is assessed as representing an increased risk to local communities. \"I see no alternative to a substantial custodial sentence.\" He warned King that any breach of the licence conditions could see him taken back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. Matt Jackson, defending, revealed his client had been convicted of assault to severe injury and danger of life, along with other offences, and was on High Court bail when he committed the crimes. Mr Jackson said King had been \"a young lad with terrific prospects\" before he turned to offending while out of work. \"Every once in a while in one's professional career one encounters an individual [whom] its baffling to understand how he's involved in and is convicted of these very serious offences.", "text": "A man has been jailed for five-and-a-half years after being found guilty of attempting to murder a father-of-three by stabbing him five times while he was on bail.", "id": "39117565", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["A man has been jailed for five-and-a-half years.", "The man was found guilty of attempting to murder a father-of-three.", "The man stashed the father-of-three five times.", "The man was on bail."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.30542288976721466}}

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office. The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office. For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. \"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments:. This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester. I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge. I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon. I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow. I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford. I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset. I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley. I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties. It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths. Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.

But what exactly will she be doing during her time in space? The ISS gives the chance to do scientific experiments that cannot be done on Earth, as the station offers an environment of microgravity. Here we run through a few examples of the experiments on Samantha's 'to do' list... Samantha will operate a gadget called an electromagnetic levitator, which can heat metals to 2,000\u00c2\u00b0C and then cool them very quickly. This will be a chance to see what happens to different metals when they go from liquid to solid, without the effect of the Earth's gravity. It's hoped the results will reveal more about the physics of the metals and how they work. Samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well they work in space, such as this astronaut joystick. Using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on Earth. So these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery. Another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so it doesn't float away. The testing will also see what impact this has. Samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects her body. For example, she will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the International Space Station and be tested to see how this affects her body clock. Another important subject is food and energy. Experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out. Samantha will record what she eats and her energy levels over a period of time. Other things that will be looked at include how space affects skin and why many astronauts get headaches.", "text": "Samantha Chandrasekaran is the latest member of the International Space Station (ISS).", "id": "30194628", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Samantha Chandrasekaran is the latest member of the International Space Station (ISS)."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.11293428391218185}}

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was \"another of these secret trials\". He said: \"Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype. \"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. \"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.

BBC Wales understands he was then left alone on the parked bus in Rhayader on two separate occasions. Powys council said there had been a \"serious breakdown in communication\". A spokesman added it had spoken to the school and all contractors to ensure immediate safeguards were put in place to prevent any similar incidents in future. The most recent incident was on Monday, when it was only noticed Reuben was missing after his sister spotted he was not present at a school swimming lesson she was teaching at Maldwyn Leisure Centre in Newtown. Police were told and Reuben was found at the Simon Price Cars bus depot. Reuben's father, Rob Lewis, said there had been \"several mistakes\" by the school and transport provider in the past year. He said Reuben was left on the bus in May last year and left at school the following December. \"I was in total and utter shock that this had happened again,\" he said. \"I'm always happy to give someone a second chance, but now I wish I'd never given them a first chance.

Local residents initially used their bare hands to dig into tonnes of mud that engulfed some 30 houses. Seven people have been saved so far. Thousands of people have fled the area. The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says many of the bodies being pulled from the mud are those of children who were playing in the streets when the landslide hit. The scar of the collapsed hillside can be seen from miles away, he adds. The landslide hit the La Gabriela district of Bello, Antioquia province, at about 1900 GMT on Sunday. In pictures: Colombia landslide. Officials originally feared that 145 people may have been buried. But the mayor of Bello, Oscar Andres Perez, told Colombian radio 123 people had been trapped. He said the hill had become increasingly saturated with water over the past few days and that there had been a \"high risk of landslides\". Mr Perez said the authorities had warned residents of the danger. Orfanely Madrigal, a Bello resident, told a local radio station she had been aware of the risk: \"I foresaw this tragedy. I told my mother this was a high-risk area but nobody believed me.\" \"I've lost half my family - my mother, four brothers, nephews and my 13- and 10-year-old daughters,\" she said. Several hundred people, including Red Cross rescue workers, soldiers and police, are digging through the deep mud in an effort to find survivors. More than 20 sniffer dogs have also been brought in. However, teams are moving cautiously for fear that heavy machinery will crush homes buried in the mud. Red Cross officials say that 174 people have died as a result of the heavy rains in Colombia, 225 have been injured and 19 are missing, without counting the victims of the Bello landslide. Tens of thousands have been left homeless after most major rivers have burst their banks as a result of the heavy rain. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has announced he is flying to Bello to personally assess the situation there. Mr Santos has said recovering from the torrential rains and the damage they have caused is going to be very expensive, and that he is considering calling a national state of emergency if the rains continue. \"Unfortunately, this tragedy has just kept growing,\" he said. Neighbouring Venezuela is also experiencing heavy flooding. Some 70,000 people have been driven from their homes there. President Hugo Chavez has said his government plans to seize private land to house some of those forced to abandon their homes.

It began when he left behind a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle for the wonder and wastelands of Sierra Leone five years ago. It will end when he walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history. Very few 29-year-olds have managed a national football team. None have done it while that country is being brought to its knees by Ebola. \"I'm very sad, very emotional,\" he said. \"Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. I don't keep my distance from things; I invest emotionally. The country has become part of me.\" Having been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24. By 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said. Two months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum. \"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\" McKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days. The journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before. A night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change. His time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on. \"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear. \"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\" McKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger. Instead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said. \"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\" In Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said. It is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began. \"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get. \"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\" McKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents. \"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me. \"Two days later they offered me the job.\" McKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue. \"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone. \"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\" The Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained. That was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said. Sierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\" Sierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September. With a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game. Sierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.' McKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. I was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when my phone buzzed with an email from one of the men I'd been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said they had terminated my contract. I was disappointed. I'd been standing in their office a few hours earlier. \"But I believe in a certain way of doing things. So I spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with them but just to go in shake hands and say 'best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months.'\" McKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, he lives and breathes it and his sense of adventure means predicting his next move is not easy. In the New Year he has a series of meetings in Asia. This is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock. The boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James' Park or leading his native Northern Ireland out. \"Nothing would make me prouder, my heart would be beating out of my chest for both those opportunities at some stage in my career.\" Watch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12:10 GMT.", "text": "Michael McKinstry's career as a football coach has been an extraordinary journey.", "id": "30472392", "label": "0", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Michael McKinstry's career as a football coach has been an extraordinary journey."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9961248636245728}}

His government has lasted just more than a year, with limited support from the main opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il. Brexit and Northern Ireland's political stalemate are among the challenges waiting for the new taoiseach. The leadership contest will begin on Thursday, with the new leader to be announced on 2 June after an electoral college of the parliamentary party. County councillors and party members will also have their say. While the field may widen before 2 June, the early favourites for the post are Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar and Housing Minister Simon Coveney. Born in Dublin, the 38-year-old is the son of a Mumbai-born doctor and a mother from County Waterford. He was privately educated and studied medicine at Trinity College in Dublin, qualifying as a GP before entering politics. He was elected to parliament in 2007 as a representative for Dublin West and held the tourism and health portfolios before taking on his current post last year. In an RT\u00c9 interview in 2015, he revealed that he is gay, explaining that he wanted to be clear on the matter ahead of the Irish referendum on same-sex marriage. \"I just kind of want to be honest with people,\" he said. \"I don't want anyone to think that I have a hidden agenda.\" Mr Varadkar has courted controversy by announcing that people convicted of welfare fraud will be \"named and shamed\" on a government website. In a recent speech reported by the Irish Independent, he outlined his attitude to Brexit, saying there should be \"no economic border at all between north and south\". The son of the former Fine Gael politician Hugh Coveney, the Cork-born 44-year-old has followed his father's footsteps to a seat in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament). As a teenager, he was expelled from the exclusive Clongowes Wood boarding school for drinking and bunking off to attend a beach party. In a candid interview with RT\u00c9, he said he had suffered from a stutter, and lived in the shadow of his more promising brother, who is now a successful businessman.

Does that mean... that I was seeking an emergency?\" he asked. Mr Tsipras did not directly address the reported details of the plan, which was to have allowed the government to introduce a parallel payment system if the banking system was closed down and the drachma had to be re-introduced. A small team in the governing Syriza party was charged with investigating how to secretly copy online tax codes and use them to issue new pin numbers for every taxpayer, to be used in transactions with the state. \"That would have created a parallel banking system while the banks were shut as a result of the ECB's aggressive action to deny us some breathing space,\" Mr Varoufakis said in a leaked phone conversation.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the attacks while the others are implicated for providing support for the co-ordinated hijacking. In May, a chaotic hearing in the case lasted 13 hours. During that hearing, which formally charged the five men, the defendants made defiant outbursts and refused to answer the judge's questions or use the translation system. In addition to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Waleed bin Attash are being prosecuted in a special military tribunal for wartime offences known as a military commission. They are charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda, terrorism, and one count of murder for each known victim of the 11 September attacks at the time the charges were filed - 2,976 in total. The five face a possible death penalty sentence if convicted. CIA waterboarding tapes revealed. On Monday, the defendants listened calmly and answered the judge's questions, although Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said: \"I don't think there's any justice in this court.\" Defence lawyers argued during the hearing that their clients should not be forced to attend the rest of the week's hearings, because the forcible transport from their high-security cells may remind them of their time at secret CIA prisons. Before their transfer to the US base at Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons. All five have said they were tortured during interrogations. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was repeatedly water-boarded before being brought to Guantanamo. \"We have to talk about torture,\" Air Force Captain Michael Schwartz, a defence lawyer, said on Monday. But Judge James Pohl said the issue was not relevant at this stage. Prosecution lawyers have said the use of waterboarding and similar methods could be relevant when determining whether prisoners' statements were voluntarily given. The court is also expected to hear a defence request to abolish what they term a \"presumptive classification\" that treats any discussion of the CIA prisons as top secret, as well as a media request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions. Judge Pohl ultimately ruled that the defendants would not be forced to attend hearings scheduled to run through the end of this week, but did not rule out further pre-trial hearings.

Scientists say the finding is \"encouraging\" and could eventually lead to new drugs to help people live longer and healthier lives. Lithium is used in psychiatry to help stop mood swings but has a risk of serious side-effects at high doses. How lithium acts on the brain is not fully understood, but in fruit flies the drug seems to extend life by blocking a chemical known as GSK-3. \"The response we've seen in flies to low doses of lithium is very encouraging and our next step is to look at targeting GSK-3 in more complex animals with the aim of eventually developing a drug regime to test in humans,\" said Prof Linda Partridge of the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing, who led the study. The research, published in Cell Reports, found fruit flies lived 16% longer than average when given low doses of lithium. At high doses, lithium reduced their lifespan. \"We found low doses not only prolong life but also shield the body from stress and block fat production for flies on a high sugar diet,\" said co-researcher Dr Ivana Bjedov from the UCL Cancer Institute.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger. Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue. \"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\" While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth. \"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission. \"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\" \"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\" Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet. \"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make. \"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\" Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii. \"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\" He added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating. \"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\" The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Mr Trump said they did not discuss his plan to make Mexico pay for the wall - a central plank of his campaign. But Mr Pena Nieto later tweeted: \"I made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall.\" After the meeting, Mr Trump flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to deliver a key speech on tackling illegal immigration. At their joint press conference in Mexico City, Mr Pena Nieto said Mexicans had been hurt by some of Mr Trump's previous comments but he believed he now genuinely wanted to build relations. The New York businessman called Mexicans \"amazing\" and \"spectacular\" people, in contrast to earlier comments branding Mexican migrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers\". Forcing Mexico to pay for a wall has become a rallying cry among his supporters. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton said not bringing it up was a sign of cowardice. \"It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it,\" she tweeted. Mexicans tell Trump: 'You're not welcome!' Donald Trump's Hispanic voter 'doomsday' 'Me gustan los tacos!': A Spanish phrasebook for Trump's visit. The Republican has seen his poll ratings slip since the party conventions last month. Both nationally and in key states, he trails Hillary Clinton, who enjoys particularly strong support among minorities. Donald Trump has called Mexico an enemy of the US, but on Wednesday he said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was his friend. That contrast illustrates how different Diplomatic Donald was from the firebrand candidate who tore through the Republican primaries by flogging his opponents for being soft on illegal immigration and border security. If the goal of Mr Trump's visit to Mexico City was to represent his nation on the world stage without the kind of embarrassment or controversy that Hillary Clinton warns would be certain if he is elected, then his last-minute trip was a success. But his surprise appearance south of the border may come with a price. It is likely to make it more difficult for him to back away from hard-line immigration positions that are unpopular among moderate voters. Perhaps more grating for Mr Trump's diehard supporters is that he had the chance to confront the Mexican leader and instead spoke of protecting \"hemispheric manufacturing\" and avoided the subject of who would pay for the border wall. Diplomatic Donald may not be the candidate they thought they were getting. Mr Trump said his words to Mr Pena Nieto had been strong and straightforward. He tried to put behind him his previous comments on Mexicans by saying those in the US had made a \"great contribution\". \"I have a great feeling for Mexicans. They are amazing people,\" he said. Mr Trump said he had employed many Mexicans and that they were \"spectacular people with strong values of faith and community\". He went on to list five points he had set out in his talks:. Mr Trump said: \"We recognise and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders.\" But he said there was no discussion on who would pay for the wall. He had earlier threatened to stop cash earned by Mexicans based in the US being sent home until the country paid for it to be built. Mr Trump concluded by saying he was honoured by Mr Pena Nieto's invitation to visit, adding: \"I call you a friend.\" Mr Pena Nieto accepted there were border challenges but pointed out the massive contribution Mexicans have made to the US, and that \"six million jobs rely on exports to Mexico\". He said: \"My priority is to protect Mexicans wherever they may be. Mexicans in the US are honest people, hard-working people who respect their families, their community and the law. They deserve everybody's respect.\" Mr Pena Nieto has invited both US candidates to visit, but has faced criticism at home over Mr Trump. Ex-President Vicente Fox earlier told CNN: \"We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject his visit.\" Former First Lady Margarita Zavala tweeted: \"We Mexicans have dignity, and we reject your hate speech.\" At least two demonstrations have been planned in Mexico City. Mexicans tell Donald Trump: 'You are not welcome' What Trump has said about Mexico. \"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\" - May 2015. Mexico is \"ripping off the US more than almost any other nation\" - February 2015. \"Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States\" - from his immigration plan. ...and what Mexico has said about Trump. President Pena Nieto spoke out against Mr Trump's \"strident rhetoric\" in March, adding: \"That's how Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in, they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis.\" His predecessor, Felipe Calderon, insisted: \"Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall.\" After Mr Trump vowed to reclaim all remittances derived from illegal wages, Mr Calderon's predecessor Vicente Fox, told the BBC: \"Is Trump going to steal the money?

Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe. He said: \"We are an unknown entity, and the bigger teams are definitely underestimating us like the big fish did in the Premier League last season. \"Getting to the semis would be remarkable. However, the drastic difference between the Champions League and Premier League form is unacceptable.\" But even if the Foxes are not quite living up to expectations on the pitch, Richard III has helped keep the city buzzing. Amy Gray, head of tourism affairs at VisitBritain, said: \"Money can't buy the publicity - the sort of publicity Leicester has got. \"We saw a 17% increase in international visitors to the East Midlands for April to June. \"What we've seen in Leicester is a fantastic heritage story and a fantastic sports story - and we know both are a fantastic draw to international visitors.\" Source: Leicester Cathedral. Eloic Montagnier, general manager of Leicester's Belmont Hotel, believes interest in other Leicester destinations - such as the National Space Centre after Tim Peake's expedition - has also contributed to the city's success. He said: \"We have done over 80% [occupancy] for the last year. \"It was fantastic in November, with 85% occupancy for the month - it was 65% two years ago. \"I think this is a great opportunity to grow the city and I think it will keep going - I don't see the success dropping off any time soon. \"Football has brought a lot of people in who may never have even considered coming to Leicester.\" But others aren't quite so bullish about the future. Vito Ferro's San Carlo restaurant has become something of a tourist hotspot after it held a celebratory meal for the Leicester City players the day after the title was won.

Rodgers can give Celtic hope - Sutton. \"The club has been in magnificent shape in recent years and has collected silverware regularly during this time. \"My objective now, of course, is to continue this work, to keep us at the top and again make our mark in Europe.\" Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Celtic's largest individual shareholder Dermot Desmond described Rodgers as \"a great manager\", adding that the Scottish Premiership club had interviewed \"in excess of six\" candidates,. It also emerged that Rodgers met club representatives for several hours on Wednesday. \"Brendan is a highly-sought after manager and we are pleased we have been able to bring such a high calibre individual to Celtic,\" said chief executive Peter Lawwell. \"I know Brendan feels privileged to be named Celtic manager and he will bring huge experience, knowledge and ability to the role. \"We wanted to bring one of the biggest and best names to the club to match our own aspirations and those of our supporters - we believe, in appointing Brendan, that we have done this. \"We have appointed a special manager and we are sure he can bring some special times to Celtic.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. Rodgers moved into management with Watford and subsequently had a spell in charge of Reading before leading Swansea City to promotion to the Premier League. A switch to Liverpool followed and Rodgers came close to the title in 2013-2014, finishing two points behind Manchester City. However, he left Anfield without winning a trophy. Rodgers will come up against Rangers manager Mark Warburton next season, with the two men having worked together on the coaching staff at Watford. \"He's very experienced, well organised, a good motivator, a good man-manager,\" Warburton said this week. \"He's a manager of the highest quality.\" John Hartson, a former Celtic striker is also a fan of Rodgers and believes his appointment will be warmly greeted by the Celtic supporters. \"I think they've got themselves a proper manager of the highest regard,\" the former Wales international said. \"I think he'll do very, very well. It's a great opportunity for Brendan and I think the fans will embrace his appointment. \" 'Rodgers has to not pretend to reinvent football as he did at Liverpool' Former Celtic manager John Barnes is not surprised that the club have managed to lure Rodgers. \"He will not view it as a step down, despite what others will think,\" he said. \"Celtic is a huge club.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "In a scrappy first half, Joe Garner drew a save from Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis and crossed for Martyn Waghorn to volley over. Aberdeen dominated after the break as Wes Foderingham saved from Kenny McLean and twice from striker Adam Rooney. But Kenny Miller's brace and Joe Dodoo's third earned Rangers the win. Aberdeen are still well placed to finish runners-up to Premiership champions Celtic, with nine points and a far superior goal difference separating them from Rangers with only six games remaining. Derek McInnes's men started the match as favourites and the early signs suggested they would live up to their billing as they pressed, fought and chased Rangers across every inch of the pitch. It was more a bruising battle than a beautiful game, though, and referee Kevin Clancy was flashing cards early, with Garner and Ryan Jack the first to be booked as they squared up to each other. For all its lack of free-flowing football, it was a very watchable spectacle. Jonny Hayes forced a low save from Foderingham at one end and Waghorn should have burst the net rather than volleying over after a sumptuous cross from Garner on the right. The visitors actually enjoyed the best chances in the early stages despite their lack of fluidity in midfield. Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said beforehand that his players were entering hell with this trip but it looked more like limbo as both sides continued to cancel each other out. The Portuguese was also well aware that anything other than victory would see his side consigned to third at best. The Ibrox side have obvious frailties at the moment, especially in defence where youngsters are deputising for more experienced injured regulars, but they showed fight and spirit that would be rewarded later in the match. Young David Bates looked slow and ponderous at times although Myles Beerman at left-back was composed and calm when needed. When Aberdeen click, it is mostly down to the hard work of their impressive wide men and so it was in the second half as Niall McGinn and Hayes terrorised the Rangers full-backs. Hayes skipped past two on his way to the box but Graeme Shinnie's hooked shot was blocked by Foderingham. McGinn was at it on the other side and his trickery was feeding Rooney but his fellow Irishman could not convert despite several gilt-edged invitations. You could sense the tide turning though and Rangers were struggling to contain the waves of red battering their defences. For all their efforts though, few chances were seriously testing Foderingham. With 11 minutes remaining, veteran striker Miller scored his 10th goal in 40 appearances this season. Against the run of play, Waghorn created space for himself in the box and when his shot was saved, 37-year-old Miller lashed a fabulous effort high into the back of the net. Aberdeen had no time to compose themselves before Miller made it two when he skipped through a defence in disarray to slide neatly past Lewis and send the small band of Rangers fans wild. Substitute Dodoo played his part in that second goal and he slammed home a third to complete an incredible five minute turnaround that sent the Dons fans scurrying for the exits in disbelief. Those who remained in defiance almost witnessed a Miller hat-trick as he followed up on Dodoo's shot that came back off the crossbar but defender Andrew Considine spared further blushes as he cleared off the line.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "He was speaking in a BBC interview after a Russian court declared him \"under arrest in absentia\" over the 1990s murder of a Siberian mayor. \"Definitely I'm considering asking for asylum in the UK,\" he said. Mr Putin \"sees me - it's obvious now - as a serious threat\", he said. Once Russia's richest man, the former head of the now defunct Yukos oil firm spent 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. Mr Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he now lives abroad, mainly in Switzerland. \"I'm considered by President Putin as a threat, economically, because of the possible seizure of Russian assets abroad, and politically, as someone who will potentially help democratic candidates in the coming 2016 elections,\" he said. Russia will hold elections to the lower house of parliament - the State Duma - next year. The Duma is currently dominated by Mr Putin's supporters. The BBC's Richard Galpin asked Mr Khodorkovsky whether he felt at risk in light of the murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin in recent years. Among them was former secret agent Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in a London hotel in 2006. \"The history of deaths of opponents of this regime is impressive... but I was in jail for 10 years, I could have been killed any day easily. In London I feel much safer than during those years,\" he replied. When he left Russia in 2013 he said he would not get involved in politics - which was widely believed to have been the reason for his early release. He told the BBC on Wednesday that he would \"help young political activists in Russia to gain political experience and present an alternative to the existing regime\". He said it was \"far too optimistic\" to speak of regime change in Russia now, \"but I'm quite confident that within 10 years the regime will be changed and I hope I will play a significant role in that\". Earlier, referring to the Russian order for his arrest, he said the Moscow authorities had \"gone mad\". He is accused of ordering several of his employees to kill both the mayor and a businessman, who survived. Investigators allege Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, was killed on 26 June 1998 for demanding Mr Khodorkovsky's oil firm, Yukos, pay taxes that the company had allegedly been avoiding. Local businessman Yevgeny Rybin was allegedly targeted because his activities \"clashed with Yukos's interests\", Russia's powerful Investigative Committee (SK) said in a statement (in Russian). Mr Rybin survived a gun attack in November 1998 and a second attack on his car in March 1999, when another man in the vehicle was killed and several people were injured. Five people have already been tried for the attacks and the arrest warrant is unlikely to make any difference unless Mr Khodorkovsky returns to Russia, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Armed police raided the Moscow offices of Mr Khodorkovsky's Open Russia pro-democracy movement on Tuesday, in a move that authorities said was linked to allegations of tax evasion. The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched. After Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm. Last year an international arbitration court in The Hague said Russian officials had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Yukos, and jail Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The court told Russia to pay former shareholders in Yukos $50bn (\u00c2\u00a332bn) in compensation. 1963 - Born in Moscow, son of chemical engineers. 1987 - Founds Menatep bank. 1995 - Buys Yukos for $350m, with Menatep assuming $2bn in debt. 2003 - Arrested for tax evasion, embezzlement and fraud. 2005 - Found guilty on six of seven charges, jailed for eight years. 2007 - Yukos declared bankrupt. 2010 - Convicted of embezzlement and money laundering. 2013 - Pardoned by President Putin after request for clemency; leaves Russia for Germany. 2015 - Charged with ordering 1990s murder of Siberian mayor; says he is considering asking for political asylum in the UK.", "text": "Former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has said he is considering seeking political asylum in the UK because he is considered a \"threat\" to President Vladimir Putin.", "id": "35172909", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky said he is considering seeking political asylum in the UK.", "Mikhail Khodorkovsky is considered a 'threat' to President Vladimir Putin."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9974090158939362}}

Perkins, of Heene Road, Enfield, Collins, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, Jones, of Park Avenue, Enfield and Reader, of Dartford Road, Dartford, were arrested in May. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle, namely to enter Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London with intent to steal, between 1 January and 7 April. The four men also faced a charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, but the prosecution said they would not pursue the charge in light of the men's guilty pleas in relation to the conspiracy to burgle charge. Earlier this month a law firm confirmed the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit had gone into liquidation as the company was insolvent and \"owes money to companies and people\". The men will be sentenced at a date to be confirmed. After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response.

Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow. US President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow. But the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign. US intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election. Rex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man. So far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a \"Good Morning, y'all\" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany. So we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth. \"Good try,\" Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond. He did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work. And three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week. Mr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job. He said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments. \"As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people,\" he said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. The secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region. Russia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014. Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where \"terrorism has put down roots\". However, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago. Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions. Mr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. At a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to \"restore co-operation with the Pentagon\". \"We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward,\" he told reporters. The defence secretary said that Russia had to abide by international law, adding that there was \"little doubt\" that Moscow had interfered or attempted to interfere in several Western elections.", "text": "The US has said it is willing to co-operate with Russia in the fight against terrorism but will stand up for its own interests in areas where the two sides do not see eye to eye.", "id": "38988639", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["The US has said it is willing to co-operate with Russia in the fight against terrorism.", "The US will stand up for its own interests in areas where the two sides do not see eye to eye."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": 0.9982625544071198}}

The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. Thursday's advance brings the army within less than a mile (1.6km) of western Mosul, where the militants are expected to launch attacks from densely populated neighbourhoods. After darkness fell, government armour could be seen lining up for a new move forward, the BBC's Quentin Sommerville reports from the scene. Thursday's assault began with air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told the Associated Press news agency, without specifying their nationality. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS but our correspondent, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It is a large piece of land and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city. Aram Shakaram, the country deputy director for Save the Children in Iraq, told the BBC he believed relatively few people had been able to escape the city since Wednesday. He said the charity believed that nearly 800,000 people were still trapped there. We are very scared, and we are worried that the final stages are going to take long.

The militant group Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, called the Israeli report worthless. It comes ahead of the publication of a UN inquiry into possible war crimes committed during the war, a report Israel dismissed as a waste of time. The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. The 277-page report, released by the Israeli foreign ministry, disputed the UN figures, estimating that 2,125 Palestinians had been killed, including 936 militants and 761 civilians, with the status of the remaining casualties unknown. It said that Hamas militants disguised themselves as civilians and converted civilian buildings into military centres. \"This exploitation of civilian surroundings - which often constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity - posed significant operational, legal and ethical challenges for the IDF,\" the report said. \"Harm to the civilian population... occurred as the result of unfortunate - yet lawful - incidental effects of legitimate military action in the vicinity of civilians and their surroundings,\" it added. \"Israel did not intend, and deeply regrets, the harm caused to the Palestinian civilian population and surroundings during the 2014 Gaza Conflict.\" A spokesman for Hamas said the Israeli report was \"valueless\". \"Israeli war crimes are clear because they were committed in front of live cameras,\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. Meanwhile, a report from the UN Human Rights Council on the war is also expected to be published this week. The council says its inquiry will cover \"all violations of international humanitarian law\" committed by both sides during the Gaza conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday: \"Whoever wants a baseless, automatic accusation against Israel can waste their time reading the UN report.\" In April, a UN inquiry said that at least 44 Palestinians had been killed by \"Israeli actions\" while sheltering at seven UN schools during the war.

It was a memorable win for the Liberians against Kabylie who are among the 10 most successful clubs in African competitions. Mulbah broke the deadlock in a goalmouth scramble on 58 minutes and completed the rout after Sarkoh punished a blunder from Algeria goalkeeper Malek Asselah. The unexpectedly heavy loss for Kabylie was another blow to Algerian football, after the Desert Foxes were eliminated from the recent Africa Cup of Nations at the group phase. Kabylie's loss was followed by defeat for another Algerian side, Mouloudia Alger, who are also former African champions.

Bosnian Enes Sipovic notched the second-half winner as Ittihad Tanger of Morocco, experiencing continental football for the first time, came from behind to defeat Douanes of Niger 2-1 in Niamey. There was more success for Morocco as second division outfit MAS Fes used home advantage to build a 3-0 lead over former African champions CARA of Congo Brazzaville. An embarrassing blunder by the Congolese goalkeeper, who allowed a harmless low cross to slip from his grasp, gifted Ivorian Koffi Boua the first goal for 2011 Confederation Cup winners Fes.

Al-Rai's capture after several days of heavy fighting secures an important supply line from Turkey for the rebels. Separately, at least 200 people are missing after an IS attack on a factory near Damascus, the government says. Workers were reportedly taken from a dormitory where they were staying on the outskirts of the town of Dumeir, about 40km (25 miles) east of the capital. Activists from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say about 140 workers managed to escape. Initially there was confusion over who attacked the factory, with some sources suggesting the abductions were carried out by a rebel group called Jaysh Tahrir al-Sham. A factory administrator said no-one had been able to contact the workers since the assault on Monday. The area around Dumeir has seen fierce fighting between government forces and IS militants in recent days. The BBC's Lina Sinjab in Lebanon says that al-Rai is a crucial stronghold for IS as it sits on a crossing linking Turkey to Syria. The Observatory said that an alliance of \"rebel factions and Islamists\" had captured the town.

The youngster had never even walked the Aintree course before Saturday's race, but he showed his skill to make up three lengths on The Last Samuri after the final fence to take the lead at the Elbow and go on to win. Rule The World, who has twice broken his pelvis, was the first horse since the 19th century to claim his maiden win over fences at the Grand National. David Mullins was pleased to play his part in the victory for owners Gigginstown House Stud, headed by airline boss Michael O'Leary. \"Credit to Mouse, he told me before that this is probably one of the best horses he's ever had, he's just had small problems,\" added the teenager. \"So to get the call to ride this one was amazing. \"I was getting worried that everything was going to plan, and then we hit the fourth-last [fence], and I was kind of delighted once we got back into a rhythm after that that something had gone wrong and it was going to happen coming across the line.\" While there was joy for Mullins, there was frustration for Gigginstown's retained jockey Bryan Cooper, who opted to ride the winner's stable-mate First Lieutenant. They fell at the second.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts. A short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York's World Cup \"viewing parties\", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team. So it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game. That line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date.  It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling. True, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near. Up until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws. Absent from the US game are big-name male stars and big-name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid. However, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does it offer proof of America's sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic. Already, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103,432 in 1974. Major League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19,148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball. Though the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, they are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship. Bundesliga: 43,532. Premier League: 36,083. La Liga: 26,803. Serie A: 22,019. Major League Soccer (in 2014): 19,148. The Seattle Sounders, America's most-watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea. The strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how its popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better-supported sides. Last year's World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16. And even after it exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29.2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina. By comparison, that year's baseball world series attracted 13.5 million. Nor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but it has been growing. The average viewing figure for matches in last year's World Cup matches was 4.3 million, up 50% from 2010. All those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching it. More video:. Soccer seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsissyball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Deep South. Why US soccer has no relegation. Do Native Americans play football? Football in America also transcends the gender divide. Of the kids playing the game, 48% are girls. The USA has twice won Fifa's Women's World Cup, a record matched only by Germany. Mia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America's greatest female athlete of the past 40 years. In terms of her marketability, Nike ranked her alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan. It is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country's army of suburban \"soccer moms.\" The term is hardly new. It was coined in the mid-1990s. Money is another indicator of the game's attractiveness. NBC splashed out $240m (\u00c2\u00a3160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013-16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract. With a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure. The wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport. Gone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe. Now every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League. On Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel's rapid rise. No longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie (a draw). Many Americans are now fully literate in the sport. So while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that it remains a niche sport is absurd. Though gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the \"Big Four\" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet. It is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls. There are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions. Two of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game. Jack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. Prosecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system. But although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, they do not regard soccer as a foreign sport. Announcing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources.

{"dataset": "Cao22", "origin": "xsum", "article": "He was rattling across the arid wastes of the Baluch desert in Pakistan on Saturday morning in that most Afghan of cars - a battered white Toyota Corrola - when the missile, fired from a US drone, struck his vehicle. All that was left was a charred and twisted wreck beside the desert highway. US President Barack Obama described his death as an \"important milestone\", but disentangling what it actually marks is not straightforward. The most obvious question is what it will mean for the Taliban. The Pentagon said it had targeted Mansour because he had become \"an obstacle to peace and reconciliation\". But it isn't clear that the new leader will be any more open towards the peace process. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada was Mullah Mansour's former deputy, and the official line from the Taliban is that his approach is going to be very similar. What's more, his appointment doesn't rule out the possibility of a battle for succession. Mansour struggled to contain the splintering of the movement into a series of factions that followed the death of Mullah Omar, the founder of the Taliban. That would increase instability in Afghanistan, fuelling local conflicts and entrenching the insurgency. Taliban leader Mullah Mansour killed, Afghans confirm. Afghan Taliban announce successor to Mullah Mansour. Mullah Mansour's battle to be leader. Who are the Taliban? Profile: Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. Then, there is the question of what it means for US relations with Pakistan, which are regarded as crucial to the effort to fight global terrorism. The drone attack suggests the US has lost patience with the Pakistani authorities, which have failed to bring the Taliban to the table, while allegedly harbouring the movement's leaders. So the killing of Mullah Mansour may actually set back the efforts to negotiate a peace settlement. On Monday, the US ambassador was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry to be harangued about what it described as a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty\". The official Pakistani line is that the attack will be an obstacle to future talks. The third question is the one most likely to affect those outside the region: the impact on the drugs trade. It would be tempting to conclude that removing Mansour will make the battle to eradicate opium more straightforward. Mansour helped oversee the transformation of the Taliban from a movement of pious fanatics, largely funded by true believers from abroad, into something very different. After the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, remittances from the Gulf fell away. The Taliban needed new sources of finance. Mullah Mansour is thought to have developed a huge new source of income for the Taliban - along the way enriching himself and his fellow tribesmen. The movement he officially took over last year had been refashioned into what is, in effect, a multi-billion dollar drugs cartel. Afghanistan has now completely eclipsed the former hub of world opium production, the so-called Golden Triangle between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. But whether the death of Mansour will reduce Afghanistan's opium production is a moot point. Helmand is a Taliban stronghold and traditionally accounts for around half of Afghan opium output. A senior official admitted to the BBC that the intense conflict in the province meant there had been virtually no eradication effort at all this season. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some farmers are moving away from poppy and back to less profitable food crops. One reason may be the effects of a mysterious blight that badly affected last year's poppy harvest. Take a look at the changing patterns of cultivation in these desert areas of Helmand. These images are taken from a forthcoming AREU Watching Brief: Moving with the times: How opium poppy cultivation had adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that poppy production has increased in areas that are - nominally at least - controlled by the government. Last week, I visited an agricultural community just half an hour away from Mazar-e-Sharif in the north of Afghanistan. The city is, by Afghan standards, a model of good governance and has never been a stronghold of the Taliban, yet I found poppy being grown openly. Conversations with locals suggest that poppy production is not just tolerated, but is actively supported and protected by local police and government officials in return for kickbacks. \"Of course the authorities know we are growing poppies,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told me. \"They can see we are growing it, but they've got to keep quiet about it. The economy here is weak, people have no money. \"The authorities know poppy is the only way people here can make decent money, and they know that people would be very angry if they stopped them.\" He said if the government came in and destroyed his crop or that of other farmers, they would \"take to the mountains\". \"The people will take up arms,\" he told me. \"They'll have no choice but to rebel and there will be chaos here.\" Experts on opium cultivation say this is a pattern repeated across the country. They say opium cultivation is a sign of the weakness of the government. It occurs when local authorities have no choice but to come to an accommodation with farmers. On that basis, there has been a steady deterioration of central authority, as this chart illustrates. It is striking that more opium was produced in 2014, the last year of the Nato combat mission, than in any other year since the UN started keeping records in 2002. Mansour may be dead - but, in the absence of other successful businesses, the opium trade has become an increasingly important enterprise in areas the government controls as well as Taliban-controlled areas. What that suggests is that, whoever is leader of the Taliban, Afghanistan is likely to continue to be the world centre of opium production. Indeed, this year, Afghanistan is expected to produce more opium - and therefore heroin - than the world consumes. It isn't hard to work out what that means: more and cheaper heroin coming to a street near you.", "text": "Mullah Akhtar Mansour, the Afghan Taliban leader who was killed in a US drone strike last week, was a man of few words.", "id": "36370553", "label": "1", "model_name": "BART", "text_claims": ["Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a US drone strike last week.", "Mullah Akhtar Mansour was a man of few words."], "score": {"FENICE-lower_t5-claims-val-sota-scorer-avg": -0.027602404356002808}}

His career high came in the 1970s and included the anthemic Baker Street and Stuck in the Middle with You, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel. Rafferty had battled a drink problem and spent time in hospital in Bournemouth with liver failure. He was born in Paisley and began his musical career as a busker on the London Underground. Rafferty died peacefully at his home in Dorset, with his daughter Martha at his bedside. It is understood his funeral will be held in Paisley later this month. Rafferty had recorded and toured with Billy Connolly as part of the Humblebums, before forming Stealers Wheel with his friend Joe Egan in 1972. Stuck in the Middle with You was a hit in the early 70s and also appeared on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. Baker Street charted in the UK and US in 1978 after Rafferty began his solo career and still achieves airplay on radio stations around the world. Musican Raphael Ravenscroft, who played the song's famous saxophone melody, described Rafferty as \"a fantastic writer\" who \"wrote some of my favourite songs of all time.\" In a statement, Billy Connolly called Rafferty \"a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed\". He added, \"I was privileged to have spent my formative years working with Gerry and there remained a strong bond of friendship between us that lasted until his untimely death. \"Gerry had extraordinary gifts and his premature passing deprives the world of a true genius.\" Music journalist and BBC Radio 2 presenter Paul Gambaccini said it was a cruel irony that Baker Street, about Rafferty's unhappiness with being a star, brought him more of the fame he hated. Gambaccini said: \"He just wasn't of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it. \"And thus he found fame and artistic success incompatible, and he became a wanderer, a lonely man, allegedly a drinker. And now we have this unhappy end.\" Musician and BBC 6 Music presenter Tom Robinson said Rafferty would be greatly missed. \"I'm deeply saddened to hear that Gerry has lost the battle with his failing health,\" he said. \"His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me. \"Many of us had hoped his recent album Life Goes On in 2009 would lead to a full-time return to writing and performing for a lyrical and highly gifted artist.\" BBC News website readers from around the world have sent in their tributes:.

Have followed his releases from Stealers Wheel to present. He wrote beautiful songs and he and Joe Egan, who sadly didn't get the same recognition, have left me some great musical memories. George Morris, Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland. As a muso myself, I loved the arrangement of the haunting Baker Street and often performed Stuck In The Middle With You with a band I was a part of in the 80s and 90s in England.

The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is \u00a3555,000. The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery. Diallo, who was from a prosperous family of religious clerics, was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America. Read Will's blog. After he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo's intellect and education, took him to England. Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare's painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal. A spokesman for the gallery told the BBC News website that the work - which had been in a private collection - had sold at auction in Christie's in London in December for \u00a3554,937.50. Following the sale, then Culture Minister Margaret Hodge put a temporary export bar on the painting and gave British museums and galleries the opportunity to buy it if they could match the price. The Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund have already given grants of \u00a3333,000 and \u00a3100,000, while the NPG has also contributed.
